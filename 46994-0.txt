                                       GENEVA, N. Y., _October_ 1, 1921.

 _To the Honorable Board of Control of the New York Agricultural
 Experiment Station_:

 GENTLEMEN:--I have the honor to transmit herewith the manuscript of
 the sixth of the series of monographs on fruits, to be entitled "The
 Pears of New York." I recommend that, under the authority of chapter
 636 of the Laws of 1919, this be submitted for publication as Part II
 of the report of this Station for 1921.

 The wide-spread use of and frequent expressions of appreciation
 for the preceding books of this series are ample justification for
 the preparation and publication of this similar treatise on pears.
 Further, the added years of experience and observation of Dr. Hedrick
 and his assistants serve to bring each successive monograph to a
 higher state of excellence and completeness. The present work is a
 splendid example of painstaking care in the collection and compilation
 of all available evidence concerning all known varieties of pears.

 With the publication of this volume, the series will include books
 on apples, peaches, plums, cherries and pears, all of our leading
 tree-fruits of the non-citrus type. The book on grapes and the
 "Sturtevant's Notes on Edible Plants" are similar treatises published
 in uniform style with those dealing with tree-fruits and it is
 hoped that the series may eventually be extended to include similar
 discussions of small fruits.

 "The Pears of New York" cannot fail to find an extremely useful place
 in the literature of fruit-growing, and its publication will be
 welcomed by the fruit growers of the State and by horticulturists the
 world over.

                                PREFACE


_The Pears of New York_ is sixth in the series of books on hardy fruits
being published by the New York Agricultural Experiment Station. The
object and scope of these treatises have been given in prefaces of
the preceding books, and though this work does not differ from its
predecessors, for the convenience of readers the aim and the contents
of the book in hand are set forth in this foreword.

Broadly speaking, the aim is to make _The Pears of New York_ a complete
record of the development of the pear wherever cultivated up to the
present time. With this end in view an attempt is made: To give an
account of the history and uses of the pear; to depict the botanical
characters of cultivated pears; to describe pear growing in this
country and more particularly in New York; and, lastly, to give in
full detail the synonymy, bibliography, economic status, and full
descriptions of the most important cultivated pears with brief notices
of varieties of minor importance.

The reader will want to know what considerations have governed the
selection of varieties for color plates and full descriptions. These
are several: (1) The value of a variety for home or commercial
orchards. (2) Noteworthy new varieties. (3) Varieties desirable in
breeding new pears. (4) A few sorts are described and illustrated to
show the trend of evolution in the pear.

In the use of horticultural names the rules of the American Pomological
Society as adopted at the meeting in Columbus, Ohio, in 1919, have been
followed. With a very few varieties these rules have not been followed
since the changes required by their strict observance would augment
rather than diminish confusion.

The references given are those that have been used in ascertaining
the history and economic status or in verifying the description of
varieties. The synonyms created by pomologists whose works we have had
have been noted, but in no case are synonyms given only when quoted by
pomologists from another writer. One of the chief aims of _The Pears of
New York_ is to set straight in high degree the names of pears.

Biographical sketches of men who have been most prominent in pear
growing in the United States are to be found in the footnotes. These
are written to give in some measure the credit and honor due to those
who introduced new varieties or improved their culture. A knowledge of
the career of these men is indispensable to a full comprehension of the
industry of growing pears.

                         THE PEARS OF NEW YORK




                               CHAPTER I

                          HISTORY OF THE PEAR


The pear has no history if history be defined as a record of evolution.
Even the annals of the pear, which but state events in chronological
order, are a heap of confused facts and dates with important data
missing at every turn. The origin of the cultivated pear is so
completely hidden in prehistoric darkness that it can never be known
precisely from what wild pear it came. The historian must content
himself with recording what the pear was when written records began;
what the touch of time has done since the first written accounts; and
what the events and by whom directed which have aided time in making
its impressions since cultivated pears have accompanied its flight.

Happily, it does not matter much what the pear was before husbandmen
appeared on the scene. But from the day the pear began to supply the
needs of men, and in its turn to require ministration from those it
nourished, its history becomes of importance to all mankind. Those whom
it helps sustain as well as those who tend the pear, may well ask:
What was the raw material when the domestication of the pear began?
How has this material been fashioned into the pear of the present? Who
began domestication and who has carried it forward? And, gauged by
past progress, what further progress is possible? These are questions
of prime importance to those who seek to improve the pear; they throw
light on the culture of the pear; and they are of general interest
to all husbandmen, and to all interested in the world's food supply.
The history of the pear is important, as has been said, only as it is
connected with the history of man. Yet, this history must begin with
the wild pear.


                              WILD PEARS

Botanists number from twenty to twenty-five species of pears, all of
which are found in the northern hemisphere of the Old World, there
being no true pear native to the southern hemisphere or to the New
World. Some ten or twelve wild pears are found in China, several of
which overrun the limits of China; three or four are natives of Japan;
at least one has its habitat in Korea; another is to be found in the
western Himalayas; while the remainder, some eight or ten species,
are found westward from Turkestan, through Persia and Asia Minor into
southern and western Europe and northern Africa. From these statements
as to habitats it is seen that pears grow wild over a very extended
area and under quite varied conditions; therefore, it would be expected
that the several species are quite distinct, differing chiefly,
however, from a horticultural point of view, in the fruits.

But three of these wild species are now under common cultivation,
though it is possible that through hybridization the blood of one or
two more are to be found in cultivated varieties. Several others have
horticultural possibilities either for their fruit, as means through
which new characters may be introduced into cultivated pears, or as
stocks upon which to grow orchard varieties. The three species of chief
horticultural importance are _Pyrus communis_ Linn., _P. nivalis_
Jacq., and _P. serotina_ Rehd.

The pear of common cultivation in ancient and modern orchards is _Pyrus
communis_, native of southern Europe and Asia as far east as Kashmir.
The species is now to be found naturalized in forests and byways of
northern Europe, as it is in parts of America, so that it is impossible
to tell precisely what its ancient habitat was. While most often to be
found in mountainous regions in the great area which it inhabits, wild
pears are common enough in the forests of Europe and western Asia so
that it is probable that most of the early inhabitants of this part
of the Old World enlivened their fare, obtained with the spear or the
bow, with ready-made food from the pear. The species runs into at least
three botanical forms, a dozen or more horticultural divisions and
between two and three thousand orchard varieties.

_Pyrus nivalis_, the Snow pear, is a small tree native of southern
Europe, more particularly of Austria and northern Italy, from which
region it has spread in modern times as an escape from cultivation
into neighboring countries. It is called Snow pear because the fruits
are not fit to eat until after snow falls. The French call it the
"Sage-leaved pear" (_Poirier sauger_), from the fact that the under
side of the leaves is covered with down so that the leaf resembles
that of garden sage. The Snow pear is cultivated in southern Europe,
particularly in France, for the making of perry for which purpose
several varieties are grown. Probably the Greeks and Romans used fruit
of this species for perry so that it may be said to have had attention
from man, if not care under cultivation, from the earliest times. It
is doubtful if it has been hybridized with _P. communis_, parent of
nearly all cultivated pears. The Snow pear is not cultivated in America
but is to be found in botanical collections.

From _Pyrus serotina_ came the Japanese, Chinese, or Sand pears of
pomologists. The species is a native of central and eastern China and
is found wild in Japan, but whether as a native or as an escape from
cultivation it is impossible to say. There are three botanical forms of
the species and possibly a score of horticultural varieties cultivated
for their fruits and as ornamentals. Of all the species of Pyrus found
in western Asia, this, in the light of present knowledge, is most
closely related to the common pear, with which it hybridizes freely.

We have now discovered in what countries the progenitors of cultivated
pears grow spontaneously, and are therefore ready to search for the
first landmarks in the domestication of the three cultivated species.
What has ancient literature to say on the subject? We turn first to the
Bible and find that the pear is not mentioned in sacred literature, and
that, according to commentators on the Sanscrit and Hebrew languages,
there is no name in the tongues of Biblical lands for the pear. Nor
should we expect ancient notices of the pear in north-west India or
Persia, for the pear does not flourish in hot countries. The survey
next turns to ancient Greece where landmarks are at once sighted which
must be put down as the earliest records of the pear, and as such
deserve full consideration.


                      THE PEAR IN ANCIENT GREECE

In ancient Greece we find the first landmarks and begin the history
of the pear as a cultivated plant. It is wrong, however, to assume
that the beginning of the cultivation of the pear, or of any plant,
was contemporaneous with the writing of even the oldest books. Mention
of a cultivated plant in a book is proof that its domestication
antedates the writing of the book. It is not easy to imagine tribes of
semi-civilized men in southern Europe and Asia who did not make use of
the apples, pears, quinces, plums, cherries, almonds, olives, figs,
pomegranates, and grapes which grew wild in this land of gardens and
orchards, and who did not minister to their needs as husbandmen long
before men wrote books. Names for orchard operations, as planting,
grafting, and pruning, in the simplest dialects of primitive peoples,
establish the fact that husbandry long antedates writing, as would be
expected from the greater need of the one than of the other.

Plutarch, a Greek writer, A.D. 50-120, enlightens us as to the early
use of the pear by the Greeks, and also as to the Grecian name for the
fruit and tree. He says in his Greek Questions (51):

 "Why do the boys of the Argives playing at a certain festival call
 themselves Ballachrades? (_Ballo_, I throw; _achras_, a wild pear.)

 "It is because they say that those who were first brought down by
 Inachus (founder of Argos) from the rural districts into the plains
 were nourished on wild pears (_achrades_). But wild pears (they say)
 were first seen by the Greeks in Peloponnesus, when that country was
 still called Apia; whence wild pears were named _apioi_. (_Apios_, a
 pear-tree; _apion_, a pear.)"

The pear is one of the "gifts of the gods" which Homer tells us grew
in the garden of Alcinöus. It is certain, therefore, whether or not
this is the earliest mention of the pear in Greek literature, that in
Homer's time, nearly one thousand years before the Christian era, the
pear was cultivated in Greece. As this garden of Alcinöus furnishes the
earliest noteworthy landmarks of the pear, and is moreover the most
renowned of heroic times, an early paradise of trees, vines, and herbs,
it is worth while to take a look at it with a view of discovering the
status of the pear at this early date. Stripped of the harmonious rhyme
and pleasing rhythm of Homer's poetry, the garden is described in
English prose as follows:

 "And without the court-yard hard by the door is a great garden,
 of four plough-gates, and a hedge runs round on either side. And
 there grow tall trees blossoming, pear-trees and pomegranates, and
 apple-trees with bright fruit, and sweet figs, and olives in their
 bloom. The fruit of these trees never perisheth, neither faileth
 winter or summer, enduring through all the year. Evermore the West
 Wind blowing brings some fruits to birth and ripens others. Pear upon
 pear waxes old, and apple on apple, yea, and cluster ripens upon
 cluster of the grape, and fig upon fig. There too hath he a faithful
 vineyard planted, whereof the one part is being dried by the heat, a
 sunny plot on level ground, while other grapes men are gathering, and
 yet others they are treading in the wine-press. In the foremost row
 are unripe grapes that cast the blossom, and others there be that are
 growing black to vintaging. There too, skirting the furthest line,
 are all manner of garden beds, planted trimly, that are perpetually
 fresh, and therein are two fountains of water, whereof one scatters
 his streams all about the garden, and the other runs over against
 it beneath the threshold of the court-yard, and issues by the lofty
 house, and thence did the townsfolk draw water.--These were the
 splendid gifts of the gods in the palace of Alcinöus.[1]"

Divested of the spell with which the poet's flight of imagination
bewitches us, we find that the wonderful garden of Alcinöus is, after
all, rather trifling, probably of small extent, and containing an
orchard, a vineyard, garden beds and two fountains of water, which
brings us to the conclusion that this renowned garden would cut but a
sorry figure beside modern gardens; but, on the other hand, we are made
sure that certain fruits, among them the pear, were commonly cultivated
in Greece a thousand years before Christ's time. There is no hint in
Homer as to whether there were as yet varieties of pears, or as to
whether fruits were as yet pruned, grafted, fertilized and otherwise
cared for. For indications that these arts of the orchard were under
practice, we must pass on to the writings of another great Greek,
Theophrastus.

Between Homer and Theophrastus nearly 600 years intervene, in all
of which time traces of the pear are few and uncertain. But from
Theophrastus, to whom botanists accord the title "Father of Botany," we
know that orcharding had been making progress, and that the pear, among
other fruits, must have been as well known and nearly as well cared
for in his time, 370-286 B.C., as in this twentieth century. All the
expedients we now know to assist nature to bring pears to perfection,
save spraying and cross-pollination, were known to Theophrastus,
although of course the evolution from the wild state as indicated by
number and diversity of kinds had not progressed so far. Out of one of
the books of Theophrastus, _Enquiry into Plants_, a very good treatise
on the pear might be compiled and one better worth following than
many of his more modern imitators. To quote Theophrastus at length is
impossible, but space must be given to a summary of what he says about
pears.

Theophrastus distinguishes between wild and cultivated pears and
says that the cultivated forms have received names. He speaks of
the propagation of pears from seeds, roots, and cuttings and makes
plain that plants grown from seed "lose the character of their kind
and produce a degenerate kind." Grafting is described. The nature of
the ground is said to regulate the distance for planting pears, and
the lower slopes of hills are recommended as the best sites for pear
orchards. Root-pruning, girdling the stems, and driving iron pegs in
the trunk and other methods of "punishing" trees are said to hasten the
bearing time. Even the necessity of cross-pollination is recognized
though of course the reasons for it are not known. Thus, Theophrastus
says: "Trees which are apt to shed their fruit before ripening it are
almond, apple, pomegranate, pear, and, above all, fig and date-palm;
and men try to find the suitable remedies for this. This is the reason
for the process called 'caprification'; gall-insects come out of the
wild figs which are hanging there, eat the tops of the cultivated figs,
and so make them swell." The growth of the pear on various soils and in
diverse situations is compared; he makes mention of a "peculiar, red
and hairy worm" which infested the pear of these old Greek orchards. In
Pontus, it is stated, "pears and apples are abundant in a great variety
of forms and are excellent." "General diseases" are enumerated as
"those of being worm-eaten, sun-scorched, and rot." Certain affections
due to season and situation are mentioned, as freezing, scorching, and
injury from winds.

This is but a brief epitome of what Theophrastus writes of the pomology
of the Greeks, and only topics in which the pear is specifically
mentioned are set down and not all of these. By inference, one who
reads Theophrastus might apply much more to the pear. Yet enough has
been said to prove the point that pear culture was as well established
in Greece 300 years B.C. as in 1900 years A.D. One leaves Theophrastus,
satisfied that pear-growers of his day had about the same problems that
growers have nowadays and solved them by the same sort of reasoning
intelligence.

In crediting Theophrastus as the earliest writer on pomology, we may
assume that there were earlier writers from whom he must have received
much knowledge. Perhaps greater writers on botany and pomology preceded
him, since he cites older authors on the same subjects whose books have
been lost. His alone of the books of its kind have come down to us from
ancient Greece. Theophrastus was the friend and pupil of Aristotle,
another philosopher and prince of science, and both in turn were taught
by Plato. Who shall say, then, from whence Theophrastus received his
knowledge? Aristotle is said to have written two books on botany
antedating the _Enquiry into Plants_ of Theophrastus, neither of which
has survived the passing centuries. May not these great minds have
been indebted to authors whose books and names have perished? These
speculations serve to remind us again that the beginnings of botany and
pomology long antedate written records.

There were Greeks who wrote on agriculture after Theophrastus, and
before the Roman treatises on farm management, a few of which are to be
mentioned in the next topic. Of books, as monuments of vanished minds,
however, there are none to indicate the activities of Greek farmers who
wrote, but there are citations to show that ancient Greek literature
on farming was voluminous. Thus, Marcus Terentius Varro (B.C. 116-28),
called "the most learned of the Romans," in his eightieth year wrote a
book on Roman agriculture for the guidance of his wife in the practice
of farming. Learned old Varro believed in "book farming," or science
with practice, of which we hear so much nowadays. He begins his
treatise by invoking Greek and Roman deities to aid his wife, and names
fifty monographs on husbandry written by Greeks, in which, he tells
this early farmerette, she will find all of the practical information
she needs. This is but one of several sources from which we learn that
in the making of books on agriculture there was no end in the heroic
days of Greece as in modern times.


                       THE PEAR IN ANCIENT ROME

Italy, by common consent, is the garden of the world, and it would
be strange if the pear had not been taken to this favored land with
the earliest tillers of orchards, or if attempts had not been made to
domesticate the wild pears found in the northern mountains. And so we
may assume, with no very definite proofs, that the pear was cultivated
in ancient Rome some hundreds of years before the Christian era. In
Cato, the first book written in Latin on agriculture, the pear is
discussed, and six varieties are named and described. What had this
illustrious Roman, known generally as a statesman and scholar, to do
with pomology?

Marcus Portius Cato (B.C. 235-150), called the elder Cato, besides
serving Rome in state and army, wrote a treatise on farming,
fruit-growing, and gardening, which, first of its kind in Latin
literature, may be read with greater profit than the works of most
writers of our own day in agriculture. Cato was preeminently the first
agricultural philosopher, and no one who has followed him has packed
more shrewd agricultural philosophy in a book than he. But it is as
a pomologist that Cato concerns us most at this time. Cato describes
almost every method of propagating, grafting, caring for, and keeping
fruits known to twentieth-century fruit-growers. He describes, also,
many varieties of fruits, as well as of vegetables, grains, and breeds
of farm animals. Among Cato's fruits are six varieties of pears. What
is of especial interest in this history is that Cato writes as if the
practices of agriculture and the plants and animals he described were
not only established but ancient in his time.

Varro, whose standing as a Roman writer on agriculture is noted above,
says nothing of varieties of pears, but gives directions for grafting
pear-trees, among other methods that of inarching of which he seems
the first ancient writer to take note, thereby justifying, in small
degree, it is true, the appellation often given him, "the most modern
of all the ancients." Varro also tells how pears should be stored.
While, therefore, he says nothing that helps in following the evolution
of the pear, yet his accounts of grafting and storing make plain the
fact that this fruit was a standard product of the times. Were it worth
while, still other early Roman treatises on husbandry might be quoted
to establish the place of the pear in the agriculture of ancient Rome,
but it is chiefly in the evolution of the fruit we are concerned and so
pass from Varro to Pliny, who, in his _Natural History_, adds to Cato's
six varieties thirty-five new sorts, giving a total of forty-one for
the generation following Christ.

Pliny, more or less discredited as a scientist because he was a
compiler and, as the men of science for science sake never forget to
point out, at all times of a utilitarian bent of mind, makes a most
important contribution to the history of the pear as a domesticated
fruit. Indefatigable compiler as he was, few cultivated pears of his
or more ancient times could have escaped his notice, and the thread of
the utilitarian running through his _Natural History_ makes all the
more important what he has to say in this study of the domestication
and improvement of the pear. A good authority says that there are sixty
manuscript copies of Pliny and eighty different editions, no two of
which are exactly alike. Allowing some latitude, therefore, to the
translator, Pliny's descriptions of pears run as follows:

 "For the same reason (as in the case of apples) in the case of pears
 the name Superba (proud) is given; these are small, but earliest
 ripe. The Crustumia are most pleasant to all; next to these the
 Falerna, so called from the wine, since they have such abundance of
 sap or milk, as it is called; among these are those which others
 call Syrian from their dark color. Of the rest, some are called by
 one name in one place and by another in another. Some by their Roman
 names reveal their discoverers, as the Decimiana, and what they call
 the Pseudo-Decimiana, derived from that; the Dolabelliana with their
 long stalk; the Pomponiana of protuberant (full-breasted) shape;
 the Liceriana; the Seviana and those which spring from these, the
 Turraniana, distinguished by their length of stalk; the Favoniana
 of reddish color, a little larger than the Superba; the Lateriana;
 the Aniciana, which ripens in late autumn and has a pleasant acid
 flavor. The Tiberiana are so called because the Emperor Tiberius
 was very fond of them. They get more color from the sun and grow to
 larger size, but otherwise are the same as the Liceriana. These bear
 the name of the country from which they come; the Amerina, latest of
 all; the Picentina; the Numantina; the Alexandria; the Numidiana; the
 Greek and among them the Tarentine, the Signina, which others from
 their color call Testacea (like tiles, or brick-colored), like the
 Onychina (onyx) and Purpurea (purple). From their odor are named the
 Myrapia (myrrh-pear), Laurea (laurel), Nardina (nard); from their
 season the Hordearia (barley, at the barley-harvest); from the shape
 of their neck the Ampullacea (flask). The Coriolana and Bruttia have
 family-names (Coriolanus, Brutus); the Cucurbitina (gourd-pears) are
 so called from their bitter taste. The origin of the name is unknown
 in the case of the Barbarica and the Veneria which they call colored;
 the Regia, which are attached to a very short stalk; the Patricia; the
 Voconia, which are green and oblong. Virgil mentions also the Volema,
 taken from Cato, who names also the Sementiva and the Mustea.[2]"

It is pertinent to inquire, now, as to what types of pears the ancients
had. Such an inquiry leads up to another and much more important
question: Have new characters appeared in pears since Pliny wrote? If
so, it may be possible that we shall be forced to assume that man's
dominancy over this fruit has produced the new characters, in which
case search might be made for the key to unlock more new characters.
For the present, however, only the first question can be considered,
before going into which it is necessary to know what the most prominent
characters of the pear are. Only those of the fruit need be named.

There are twenty outstanding characters which differentiate the
varieties of pears now cultivated, not taking account of those
introduced by the hybridization of _P. communis_ with _P. serotina_
which has given pomology the Kieffer-like varieties. These characters
are: Smooth or russet skin; red, yellow, or green color; large or
small size; early or late season; long or short stem; round, oblate,
ovate, and pyriform shapes; granular, buttery, or breaking flesh;
sweet or acid flavor. In the pears described by Pliny so many of
these characters are mentioned or may be assumed to be present from
inference, that the conclusion is forced that in the many new pure-bred
pears of _P. communis_ which have come into existence since Pliny's
time, showing a great shuffling of characters in pear-breeding, it is
doubtful whether new characters have come into being in 2000 years.
This, in turn, forces the conclusion that if this fruit is to be
greatly changed, the change must come about through hybridization with
other species.

Another quotation from Pliny shows that the Romans valued pears
as a medicine as well as a food, had curious notions as to their
digestibility, and, as with most plants, ascribed other marvelous
qualities to them. Thus, Pliny says:

 "All kinds of pears, as an aliment, are indigestible, to persons in
 robust health, even; but to invalids they are forbidden as rigidly as
 wine. Boiled, however, they are remarkably agreeable and wholesome,
 those of the Crustumium in particular. All kinds of pears, too,
 boiled with honey, are wholesome to the stomach. Cataplasms of a
 resolvent nature are made with pears, and a decoction of them is
 used to disperse indurations. They are efficacious, also, in cases
 of poisoning by mushrooms and fungi, as much by reason of their
 heaviness, as by the neutralizing effects of their juice.

 "The wild pear ripens but very slowly. Cut in slices and hung in the
 air to dry, it arrests looseness of the bowels, an effect which is
 equally produced by a decoction of it taken in drink; in which case
 the leaves are also boiled up together with the fruit. The ashes of
 pear-tree wood are even more efficacious as an antidote to the poison
 of fungi.

 "A load of apples or pears, however small, is singularly fatiguing
 to beasts of burden; the best plan to counteract this, they say, is
 to give the animals some to eat, or at least to show them the fruit
 before starting."

There is in the books of these old farmer-writers a mass of sagacious
teachings which can never be outlived--will always underlay the best
practice. Followed carefully, except in the matter of pests, the
precepts of Cato and Varro would as certainly lead to success as the
mandates of the modern experiment stations with all the up-to-date
appliances for carrying out their commands. Sagacity fails, however,
in one respect in these Roman husbandmen--all are fettered by
superstitions. In these old books on the arts of husbandry, woven in
with the practical precepts, which stand well the test of science,
superstitions abound beyond present belief. Thus, whenever the
discourse turns to pears, from Diophanes, who lived in Asia Minor a
century before Christ, down through the ages in Greece, Italy, France,
Belgium to the eighteenth century in England, runs the superstition,
with various modifications, that to grow the best pears you must bore
a hole through the trunk at the ground and drive in a plug of oak
or beech over which the earth must be drawn. If the wound does not
heal, it must be washed for a fortnight with the lees of wine. As the
superstition waned, the apologetic injunction usually follows, that, in
any event the wine-lees will improve the flavor of the fruit. Another
superstition, current for centuries, accepted by Cato and Varro, and
handed on with abiding faith almost to modern times was, as stated by
Barnaby Googe, a farmer and writer subject of Queen Elizabeth, "if you
graffe your peare upon a Mulbery, you shall have red Peares." Stories
of promiscuous grafting abound in the old books. Another is that if an
apple be grafted on the pear, the fruit is a "pearmain."

After Pliny follows a dreary and impenetrable period of 1500 years,
in which time but few new facts regarding the evolution of the pear
come to light in what is now Italy. The pear is mentioned, it is true,
by many Roman writers, but all copy Theophrastus, Cato, and Pliny.
Dioscorides, a learned Greek physician and botanist, who may be said to
have been the author of the first book of "applied science" in botany,
was the great botanical and pomological authority for the first 1600
years of the present era, many editions of his book appeared and in
several languages, and it is he who is most often quoted by writers
on fruits even until the seventeenth century, but he adds nothing new
on the pear, and does not even extend the list of known varieties.
During these 1600 years a great number of voluminous commentaries
on Dioscorides appeared, in several of which names of new pears are
mentioned, but, with the exception of one writer, the descriptions are
so terse that the new sorts cannot be connected with older or later
periods. The exception is Matthiolus (1501-1577), but since the English
herbalists, in their turn, largely copy Matthiolus, with valuable
amplifications, it is better to give space further on to them.

Perhaps one more name should be mentioned among the Roman writers.
Messer Pietro de Crescenzi, an Italian born at Bologna in 1230, wrote
a book on agriculture in which the chapters on fruits are especially
well written. For reasons to be mentioned, this book had a remarkable
influence on the horticulture of Europe for the next three or four
centuries. With the discovery of printing, nearly two centuries after
the book was written, Crescenzi was published in numerous editions and
in several languages to the great enlightenment of pomologists on the
cultivation of fruits, but with small additions to the knowledge of
the fruits themselves. Whether because the book was really the most
serviceable of its kind in the world for four centuries, or whether
by virtue of the happy circumstance of being many times printed, it
had absolute supremacy over other agricultural texts, is now too
late to judge. There is good reason to suspect that Crescenzi's is
the precedence of circumstance, for he stole page after page from
Palladius, of the fourth century, who, to be sure, in his turn, copied
Columella and the Greeks. Most of these borrowings, however, meet the
requirement of being "bettered by the borrower" that separates adoption
from plagiarism.

One other landmark, though a somewhat inconspicuous one, in the history
of the pear in Italy, is deserving brief mention. Toward the middle of
the sixteenth century Agostino Gallo, an Italian, wrote _The Twenty
Days of Agriculture and the Charms of Country Life_. With the fall of
the Roman Empire in the fifth century, agriculture was reduced to the
production of the necessities of life and pomology all but perished.
It required a thousand years to recover from the domination of the
barbarian conqueror of Rome. Hence, it is not surprising that Gallo
names but twelve varieties of pears instead of the forty-one of Pliny.
Gallo says that he does not name all of the summer pears, but leaves
the inference that his list is complete for autumn and winter sorts.
There probably was a greater number under cultivation at this time
in Italy, but Gallo's list shows that the number was small. Gallo
is regarded as the restorer of agriculture in Italy after the dark
ages, and as one of the most enlightened men of his time, so that we
may accept him as an accurate historian. Besides furnishing a list
of the pears of his day in Italy, Gallo names two that are now under
cultivation--Bergamot and Bon Chrétien.


                          THE PEAR IN FRANCE

Who introduced the pear in France matters little. The Greeks who
founded Marseille 600 B.C. may have done so. The Romans, masters
of ancient Gaul for centuries, undoubtedly planted pears at widely
separated places and in earliest times of Roman occupation. Or,
and quite possibly, the original natives of the land began the
domestication of the pear for, as we have seen, two cultivated species
grow wild in what is now France. Date and manner of introduction matter
less than a recognizable landmark in the history of the pear as an
orchard plant in France. There is such a landmark and a conspicuous one.

Charlemagne, the many-sided genius who ruled the Franks in the ninth
century, exercised his powerful influence in behalf of agriculture
during the time of his reign, and to him is due credit for establishing
the first notable landmark in the history of the pear in France. We
are well informed of Charlemagne's various activities while in power,
for official annals were kept at the Frankish Court. Charlemagne's
secretary has left a biography of his master, and many of the King's
_Capitularies_, or lists of laws, are extant. In these records,
agriculture is a matter of constant comment and the pear is often
up for discussion. One quotation serves to show that this fruit was
cultivated in considerable variety in Charlemagne's orchards.

In the _Capitulaire de Villis_, Chapter LXX, Charlemagne is reported
to have commanded his orchardists to plant pears of distinct kinds for
distinct purposes. That the command was of sufficient importance to
be recorded in a capitulaire indicates that Charlemagne esteemed this
fruit. The order runs: "Plant pear trees whose products, because of
pleasant flavor, could be eaten raw, those which will furnish fruits
for cooking, and, finally, those which mature late to serve for use
in winter." There is little information in this brief command, but it
tells us that a considerable number of varieties of pears were grown
in France in the ninth century, and that they were of sufficient
importance to hold the attention of a great and busy monarch.

Either the culture of the pear abruptly ceased with the death of
Charlemagne or records ceased to be kept that would throw light on
the agriculture of the next five centuries, for from the tenth to the
fifteenth century is an uncharted waste in the history of the pear in
France. Undoubtedly pears were cultivated during this time by the monks
who had the time, the taste, and the land for carrying on agriculture.
When the pear comes to light again in the happier period for pomology
of the sixteenth century, the many names of monasteries in the list of
varieties suggest that the monks not only busied themselves with the
culture of the fruit but greatly increased the number of kinds of pears.

Three great minds now appeared to make France the leading country
in the production of agricultural literature in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries and all paid attention to pomology. The names
of Charles Estienne, Olivier de Serres, and Le Lectier in agriculture
mark the departure from traditions handed down from the old Greeks and
Romans to the beginning of a new agriculture founded on first-hand
study and observation. The printing-press, it is true, was now an
invaluable ally, but these three men were of an original bent of mind
and would have been distinguished in any period before printing.

Charles Estienne, the first and the least of these three early geniuses
of French agriculture, published several works on agriculture, mostly
compilations, but all containing original observations, in one of
which, his "Seminarium," printed in Paris in 1540, is a list of sixteen
pears with brief descriptions of each. Not one of Estienne's pears is
now important, but all appear in the histories of minor sorts in the
last chapter of this text.

De Serres, known in France as "The Father of Agriculture," published
his _Le Théâtre d'Agriculture_ in 1608, a book ever to be notable in
agriculture as the first to break wholly away from the 1600 years
of repetition of book after book in the languages of Europe which
but copied the ancients. De Serres was a good farmer--most of his
farming operations have not been improved upon; he founded the first
experimental farm of which there is record at his home near Pradel
and so became the first of a long line of modern experimenters in
agriculture. Lastly, De Serres was a charming writer and his book
rapidly ran through many editions and was translated into several
languages. To him must be given credit for first sounding the alluring
call of "back to the land" which rings from nearly every page of his
books. Here is his appeal to plant pears; and words could hardly make
it simpler, more charming, and more compelling:

 "There is no tree among all those planted which abounds so much
 in kinds of fruits as the pear tree, whose different sorts are
 innumerable and their different qualities wonderful. For from the
 month of May to that of December pears good to eat are found on the
 trees. In considering particularly the different shapes, sizes,
 colors, flavors, and odors of the pear, who will not adore the wisdom
 of the creator. Pears are found round, long 'goderonnees'[3] pointed,
 blunt, small, and large. Gold, silver, vermillion, and satin green are
 found among the pears. Sugar, honey, cinnamon, clove, flavor them.
 They smell of musk, amber, and chive. In short, so excellent are the
 fruits that an orchard would not be worth while in a place where pear
 trees do not thrive."

This laudation of the pear, in which it is made manifest that many
pears of diverse shapes, colors, flavors, and perfumes existed in the
year 1600, is all that space permits from De Serres, though much could
be quoted as to the care of pear orchards, and a list of kinds could
be given, of which, however, the descriptions count for but little. Le
Lectier, to whom we now come, is a better authority on varieties.

Le Lectier, an attorney of the king at Orleans, was an amateur fruit
collector, but a collector who reflected and printed his reflections.
He seems to have been about the first of the many collectors who,
with fruit-growing as an avocation, have zealously sought to improve
and distribute varieties, and thereby have done as much or more for
pomology than those who have made fruit-growing a vocation. Though Le
Lectier collected all of the fruits of his time and country, the pear
was mistress of his passion, a passion which gave him such pleasure
that it excited others to become amateurs and emulate him. The result
was that a country-wide taste for pears was stimulated and a veritable
craze for this fruit was started--everybody planted pears.

The famous collection of fruits was begun by Le Lectier in 1598. By
1628, the infatuation to plant had progressed until Le Lectier could
send to his fellow amateurs a catalog of his possessions of fruits
with the desire to exchange. His offer to exchange shows all of the
collector's zeal. It reads as follows:

 "I beg all those who have good fruits (not contained in the present
 Catalogue) when he obtains them to inform me of it, so that I can have
 grafts of them in exchange for those which they have not, but which
 they wish to get from me, and which I will furnish them.

              "Signed, Le Lectier, Attorney of the King at Orleans.
                                       20th of December, 1628."

From Le Lectier's list we learn that 300 years ago the French had at
least 254 pears. In this catalog are many pears in the pomologies
of today, but, unfortunately without descriptions or any attempt
to determine duplicates in names or varieties, the list serves for
little more than a monument for one of the first and one of the most
zealous collectors of pears. Le Lectier, however, may be said to have
introduced the golden age of pomology in France; for, during historical
times there seems to have been no other period in which pomology
exercised the minds and hands of well-to-do people as in the century
that followed Le Lectier. Even the kings of France took pleasure in
using the spade and the pruning-knife. La Quintinye, the best of
the pomological writers of the day, complained that the country was
overwhelmed with books on pomology. Thus, was ushered in the period
which we may call our own in which the history of the pear may be read
in books innumerable.

As steps in the progress of the pear, the number of varieties may be
noted as given by French pomologists in the modern era of pear-growing.
Merlet, 1667, describes 187 varieties; La Quintinye, 1690, 67; Duhamel,
1768, 119; the Chartreuse fathers, 1775, 102; Tollard, 1805, 120;
Noisette, 1833, 238; while Leroy, 1867, from whom the figures just
given were taken, says that in the half century preceding, the number
of pears in France was quadrupled and that there are 900 varieties
for which there are 3000 names. Leroy notes three events as the cause
of the generous multiplication of pears in the period of which he
writes: The introduction of the many varieties grown by Van Mons and
other Flemish pomologists beginning about 1805; a little later, the
establishment of exchange relations with English nurseries; and still
later, 1849, the importation of a great number of new varieties from
America. To Americans, it is particularly significant to note that the
great progress of the pear in France is due to amateur tendance and not
commercial success.


                          THE PEAR IN BELGIUM

Providence ordained Belgium to produce the modern pear. The evolution
of the pear proceeded slowly, indeed, until its culture became common
on the clayey and chalky soils in the cool, moist climate of Belgium,
where flavor, aroma, texture, size, and color reach perfection. The
pear was improved more in one century in Belgium than in all the
centuries that had past. The part Providence played in endowing the
Belgians with an ideal soil and climate for the pear, is but one of
two causes of the results in improving the pear in this country. The
other is that the Belgians, ever notable horticulturists, give the
pear assiduous care, cultivate only the most approved varieties, and
in breeding, aim ever at high quality, so that Belgian pear-growers,
as well as an ordained soil and climate, must be given credit for the
modern pear.

The early history of the pear in Belgium follows step by step that of
the pear in France. In the sixteenth century, botanists were numerous
in the Low Countries, their zeal and activity showing forth in several
of the best of the early herbals. These herbalists, however, gave scant
attention to the pear. Dodoens, most noted Belgian botanist of the
century, dismissed the matter of varieties with the statement that the
names change from village to village, and that it is therefore useless
to give them. From this we may assume that a considerable number of
pears were cultivated in Belgium at the time Dodoens wrote, about the
middle of the sixteenth century.

Pear-breeding began in Belgium about 1730, when Nicolas Hardenpont,
1705-1774, a priest in his native town of Mons, made a large sowing of
pear seed with a view of obtaining new pears of superior quality. Time
is fleeting in breeding tree fruits, and the Abbé Hardenpont waited
nearly 30 years before introducing his selected seedlings, and then,
beginning in 1758, he introduced one new variety after another until a
dozen or more new pears were accredited to him. At least six of these
are still grown in Europe, but only one, the Passe Colmar, is known
in America. But before going further with the work of the Belgian
breeders, it is necessary to take stock of what was on hand before
their time.

La Quintinye, the most noted French pomologist of his time, in 1690
listed 67 pear varieties. The Belgians probably had all of these.
What were they? Most of them were old sorts--some were centuries old.
All, so far as their histories show, originated by chance in garden,
orchard, hedge row, and forest. No one seems yet to have planted seed
with a view of obtaining new and better pears. Camerarius in 1694
had made known the fact of sex in plants. Soon after, experiments in
hybridization began, but no one as yet had hybridized pears. Lastly,
nearly all pears, before the Belgians began to improve them, were
crisp or breaking in flesh, the _crevers_ of the French, while the
soft-fleshed, melting pears, the _beurrés_ of the French, were as
yet hardly known. Now, mostly owing to the work of the Belgians, the
buttery pears predominate.

Of the means by which Hardenpont obtained his superior pears, there
is no precise knowledge. Whether his new sorts were lucky chances
out of a large number of promiscuous seedlings, or whether he was a
pioneer in hybridizing can never be known. Du Mortier, a distinguished
Belgian botanist, gives the credit of hybridization to the Abbé, basing
his opinion on the fact that the characters of most of Hardenpont's
varieties are plainly a commingling of two well-known parents which
could hardly be the case if they were happy chances were fate ever so
kindly disposed.

Hardenpont soon had many imitators in Belgium. Indeed, the Belgians
seem to have been quite carried off their feet by pear-breeding, and
during the first half of the nineteenth century a fad like the "tulip
craze" of Holland and the "mulberry craze" of America reigned in the
country. Among the breeders are found the names of priests, physicians,
scientists, apothecaries, attorneys, tradesmen, and gentlemen of
leisure. The introduction of new varieties made notable in horticulture
the towns of Mons, Tournaii, Enghien, Louvain, Malines, and Brussels.
The awarding of medals for new pears produced the horticultural
sensations of the times. Hundreds if not thousands of new varieties
were introduced, of which many, it is true, have proved worthless,
others of but secondary merit, while still others, as we shall find,
are even now among the best pears under cultivation. But the great
fact, be it remembered, is that these amateur pear-breeders wrought
in a few years a complete transformation in a fruit that had been
domesticated and had been fairly stable for over 2000 years.

A few names besides Hardenpont stand out prominently and must be
mentioned. Of these, Van Mons is best known. Jean Baptiste Van Mons,
1765-1842, was a pharmacist, physicist, and physician, one of the
savants of his time, who, late in the eighteenth century, under the
potent spell cast by Hardenpont's work, began to breed pears. Space
forbids an account of Van Mons' experiments. Suffice to say that he
introduced more than two scores of pears having lasting merit, and
that in the height of his career he had in his "Nursery of Fidelity"
at Louvain, eighty thousand seedlings. Van Mons outlives in fame the
Belgian pear-breeders of his time because he propounded a theory for
the origination of new varieties of plants, and this in its turn
is famed as the first complete system of plant improvement. Van
Mons contributed but little of direct value to plant-breeding, but
indirectly he gave a great impetus to breeding pears and to the culture
of the pear, more especially in America, and we must therefore glance
at his theory and trace more in detail its influence on American
pear-growing.

Van Mons' theory, in brief, as expounded in various papers, is: A
species does not vary in the place in which it is born; it reproduces
only plants which resemble itself. The causes of variation are changes
in soil, climate, or temperature. Whenever a species produces one or
many varieties, these varieties continue to vary always. The source
of all variation, which is transmissible by sowing, resides in the
seeds. The older a variety, the less the seedlings vary, and the more
they tend to return toward the primitive form, without being able ever
to reach that state; the younger or newer the variety, the more the
seedlings vary.

In putting his theory in practice Van Mons took the first seeds from
wild plants or those little improved, from which he grew seedlings,
and from these the seeds were taken from the first fruits to ripen for
new sowings. This practice he repeated generation after generation.
Thus, it is seen that Van Mons was an early apostle of selection. He
is said to have distributed over 400 varieties, about 40 of which are
still under cultivation. It is to be feared, however, that Van Mons'
theory was preconceived without experiment or even observation for a
foundation. He devoted a life of most admirable zeal to verifying and
developing this vision of his early years with some material reward
it is true, but with a better foundation his prodigious labors would
have yielded greater direct results in improving the pear. Still, the
indirect results, his influence on the pomologists of two continents,
even though they did not subscribe to his theories, was more valuable
than the work of one mind and one pair of hands could possibly have
been.

There must always be pioneers, men who stray from beaten paths, but
pioneers seldom exert wide and deep influence at once--leave the worn
path, so to speak, and at once construct a macadamized road--yet this
was what Van Mons did. Pomologists agree that until his time no man had
exerted so profound an influence on pomology. His love of discovery
and love of labor permeated fruit-growing in Europe and America.
Fortunately, it was the age of the amateur fruit-grower. Pleasure
and progress, driven by curiosity, counted for more than commercial
success, so that Van Mons' new varieties at once gave him wide fame.
He was made known to American pear-growers by Robert Manning who
distributed his new varieties in this country and described them in
the horticultural literature of the day and in his _Book of Fruits_
published in 1838. Later, Andrew Jackson Downing, the brilliant genius
of American horticulture, published Van Mons' theories and described
many of his new pears in his _Fruits and Fruit Trees_, which came from
the press in 1845. Thus, Van Mons became the recognized authority in
America on all matters relating to the pear. Indeed, it is hardly too
much to say that we owe him obligations as the founder of pear-culture
in this country.

But the work of the Belgians does not end with Van Mons. There were
other breeders of pears, who, though not to be classed with Van Mons
as a Titan, lacking the quality of mind to set forth a new philosophy,
helped to enliven the impulse given by their leader to the improvement
of the pear by originating new varieties. Chief of these are Major
Espéren, of Malines, who introduced twenty of the pears mentioned in
the _Pears of New York_; Bivort, who has twenty-three to his credit;
Gregoire, forty-two; Simon Bouvier, eleven; De Jonghe, six; and De
Nelis, five. While, if the lists of varieties in the last two chapters
of this text be scanned for Belgians who introduced but one, two, or
three new pears, the list runs up into the hundreds. Labor finds its
summit in the work of these Belgian pear-breeders, who obtained petty
rewards by sifting millions of seedlings through the coarse meshes
of the sieve of selection. We can pardon these enthusiastic breeders
with grace for over-zealousness in naming varieties obtained with such
prodigious efforts.


                THE PEAR IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE

The pear can be improved only where the pear-tree flourishes, and then
only when assisted by the foresight and desire of men. This happy
combination seems not to exist in Europe outside of Italy, France,
Belgium, and England. The pear flourishes along the Danube, in parts
of Austria and southern Germany, and along the upper Rhine, but
the people of these regions seem to have been followers rather than
leaders in developing this fruit, having produced almost no meritorious
varieties. America is indebted to the vast region of central and
western Europe for but one major variety, the Forelle, and this sort is
of little importance.

Pomology, the world over, however, is indebted to Germany for much
valuable pomological literature. Cordus, Mayer, Christ, Diel, Dittrich,
Truchsess, Hinkert, Dochnahl, Oberdieck, Engelbrecht, Lauche, and
Gaucher, all Germans, and Kraft, an Austrian, have been industrious
compilers, and have given pomology some of its best texts on systematic
pomology.

Cordus, earliest German pomological writer, wrote an illuminating
chapter in the history of the pear, which must be reproduced. Valerius
Cordus, 1515-1544, a botanical genius, made botanical expeditions
to nearly every part of Germany, in the course of which he made
special study of the apple and the pear. He described fifty pears and
thirty-one apples. These descriptions are noteworthy as the earliest
for these fruits in Germany. Cordus is called by one great botanist,
"the inventor of the art of describing plants;" by another, he is said
to have been "first to teach men to cease from dependence on the poor
descriptions of the ancients and to describe plants anew from nature;"
a third botanical authority says of him, "the first of all men to excel
in plant description;" while a fourth writes of the four books of his
_Historia Plantarum_ "truly extraordinary because of the accuracy
with which the plants are described." Thus, botanists accord him
special distinction, but pomologists seem not to know this resplendent
systemist of the sixteenth century, who, as we shall see, is especially
deserving of pomological recognition.

Cordus is entitled to honor in the history of pomology as first to
print descriptions of fruits for the purpose of identifying varieties.
No doubt as soon as the earth ceased to furnish spontaneously the
primitive luxury of ready-to-eat food in the shape of fruit, making
culture necessary, varieties were acquired and became commodities as
they are today. Varieties were certain to originate under cultivation,
and their value was certain to be recognized by our first ancestors, to
whom the convenience, necessity, and expediency of having a diversity
of kinds of any fruit as well as of a means of keeping them true to
kind, must have been apparent at the beginning of fruit culture. That
such was the case, the most ancient sacred and profane writings assure
us. Varieties of the fig, olive, grape, and other fruits are mentioned
by all early writers on plants. That varieties of fruits would not come
true to seed was early known, and propagation by cuttings, layers,
and grafting was invented to preserve choice sorts. Many of the early
writers name varieties, tell from whence they came, and some set forth
a remarkable character or two, but none give detailed descriptions.
Cordus was first to engage in this sort of enterprise.

This chapter from Cordus is important, too, because it makes plain that
the pears grown in Germany four hundred years ago possessed all the
characters to be found in modern pears. Culture has increased size,
modified shapes, augmented flavors, brightened colors, and softened
textures, but no characters that can be considered new or distinct,
unit characters of the plant-breeder, have been introduced in the
four centuries that have gone by. The characters possessed by these
German pears are the same, so far as can be made out, as those of the
varieties grown by the Greeks and Latins nearly 2000 years earlier.
From this, the inference must be drawn that the characters of the pear
have not originated under cultivation but exist in wild types. New
and distinct characters can come only by hybridization with another
species. Pears within a species are changed only by a recombination of
the characters possessed by the species.

The descriptions of varieties from Cordus[4] that follow are commended
to pomologists as models of brevity and accuracy. These word-pictures
reproduce the pears as vividly as an artist could paint them. One sees
at once that Cordus was no compiler. Such descriptions as Cordus writes
can be made only in the orchard with the pear in hand.

 "The domesticated pear-tree is like the wild tree in trunk, bark,
 timber, leaves and blossoms, but has straighter and more shapely
 boughs and leaves a little larger. Of the fruits themselves, which we
 call pears, there are innumerable kinds, of which we will describe
 some that are found in Germany, adding also their German names, which
 vary, however, in the different provinces.

 "_Probstbirn_, that is, Provost pear, so-called from their broad base,
 near the stalk end in a blunt point, have a length of three inches,
 breadth a little less. Their color is pale green, speckled with green
 spots or dots; they are astringent to the taste, and by the abundance
 of their juice extinguish thirst. They ripen at the beginning of
 autumn, and quickly decay because of the abundance of watery and
 rather cold juice. They are found in abundance at Eisleben near the
 Harz forest in Saxony.

 "_Speckbirn_, that is, Lard pear, swell in the middle with a thick
 belly, from which they suddenly taper off into a point; they have a
 length of more than three inches, a width somewhat less than three
 inches; they are of pale color, and like the Provost, speckled with
 green dots, rather mild and sweet to the taste, dissolving in the
 mouth like lard, whence they have received their name, and with the
 abundance of their juice they quench thirst; when they are peeled they
 give a sweet odor. They ripen at the beginning of autumn and very
 easily decay.

 "_Kaulbirn_, that is, Ball pear, have almost the roundness of a globe,
 except that near the stalk they rise to a blunt and inconspicuous
 circle. Their length is scarcely two inches; they rarely exceed this,
 but in width slightly exceed their length. In color they are pale
 green, in taste and smell they rival the Lard with which also they
 come to ripeness; these too easily decay. They are found at Eisleben.

 "_Hanffbirn_, that is, Hemp pear, are like the Ball but a little
 larger; they have a green color, marked with spots or dots; in taste
 they correspond to the Ball, but do not dissolve so readily in the
 mouth; they ripen at the same time, and are easily affected by decay.
 These too are found at Eisleben.

 "_Glockenbirn_, that is, Bell pear, from a broad base narrow down to a
 sort of narrow neck and then end in a blunt head; they have quite the
 shape of a bell, whence they have received their name. They are wholly
 of a yellow color spotted with dots, in length a little less than
 three inches, but in width they do not reach two inches. They have no
 unpleasant odor, especially when peeled; in taste they correspond to
 the Hemp, and reach maturity at the same time, and easily decay. They
 grow in abundance at Eisleben.

 "_Königsbirn_, King's pear, or _Regalbirn_, Rule pear, that is, Royal
 pear, are large and big-bellied; they have a length sometimes of four
 inches, a width a little less; they are of bluish-gray color, but in
 that part where they have had the sun they become slightly red. They
 are astringent to the taste and with a copious juice, and that sweet
 and something like wine, they allay thirst. They ripen when the sun
 has entered Libra, and do not so easily decay.

 "_Klunssbirn_, that is, Lump pear, are of two varieties; both kinds,
 however, correspond proportionately in shape to the Royal, but are
 inferior to them in size. There is a difference in color, for one
 kind has a bluish-gray color, the other reddish-gray. They have a
 juice similar in flavor to the Royal but more acid. They ripen with
 the Royal. In Saxony there is great abundance of them, especially at
 Hildesheim.

 "_Bonnebirn_, that is, Bonn pear, so-called from the city of Bonn
 on the Rhine, from which they have been transplanted into other
 districts. They have an almost spherical shape, except that near the
 stalk they end in a blunt point. They are three inches in length, a
 little less in width. Their color is on one side green or pale, on
 the other, where they have been touched by the sun, reddish. They
 are moderately acid to the taste, and abound with copious juice,
 rather watery, very refreshing in effect. They ripen when the sun is
 hastening toward Scorpio. They are abundant at Marburg in Hesse.

 "_Schmalzbirn_ that is, Butter pear, so called because they melt in
 the mouth like fat or some liquid mixture; their fruit is generally
 swollen at the lower end and gradually tapers to a narrow neck toward
 the stem. Like gourds they are three inches in length or often more,
 but in breadth two and a half inches. They have a pale yellow color, a
 pleasing fragrance, but are very acid in taste, with the admixture of
 a peculiar, winey flavor; when insufficiently ripe and not thoroughly
 chewed or too greedily devoured they sometimes stick in the throat and
 choke the breathing; on the other hand, when ripe and well masticated
 they melt in the mouth like fat. They ripen before the sun passes into
 Libra. They are found in Hesse, especially in Frankenberg, where there
 is great abundance of them.

 "_Junckfrauenbirn gross_, that is, Maiden pear, large, are like the
 Lump pear in color and shape, but in size somewhat smaller. In taste
 they are powerfully astringent, so that they irritate the throat and
 contract the lips into a pucker like a maiden's kiss. They have a
 watery juice mixed as it were with sour wine. They ripen at the end of
 summer. At Brunswick in Saxony they are very abundant.

 "_Junckfrauenbirn klein_, that is, Maiden pear, small, from a swelling
 belly they end in a narrow neck; they have a length a little less than
 three inches, but in breadth somewhat exceed an inch and a half; they
 are of beautiful color, as if one should mix dark blue-green with
 reddish-purple; they are besides speckled with dots, acid in taste,
 and in like manner are easily dissolved in the mouth. They ripen at
 the beginning of autumn. They are much cultivated at Eisleben.

 "_Hamelsswenstebirn_, that is, Ram's paunch pear, have received their
 name from the fact that in their swelling shape they resemble the
 bellies of wethers; they swell as it were with a thick paunch; reach
 three inches in length and often even more, but less in width. In
 color they are bluish-gray, but slightly reddish on that side which
 they have turned to the sun. They have a very acid flavor, with a
 certain pleasantness and a winey juice. They ripen at the end of
 summer. They are found in Hesse and neighboring districts, and there
 are preferred to other pears.

 "_Loewenbirn_, that is, Lion pear, so called from their excellence;
 these are called Hessiatica in Thuringen and neighboring districts;
 their fruit is remarkable, holding the supremacy among all autumn
 fruits for duration and excellence of taste and juice. They are
 swollen in the lower part and generally unequal; they have a length
 of three inches and often greater; in width they not rarely exceed
 two inches. They are of greenish gray color, slightly reddened. They
 have an astringent taste of marked pleasantness. They abound in
 copious juice, winey, sweet-smelling, and very refreshing, so that
 they speedily quench thirst; indeed the pears themselves by their
 strong aromatic odor wonderfully revive the sick. They ripen when the
 sun has entered Libra; finally when stored away they last for a long
 time. They abound in Hesse, especially at Marburg and likewise at
 Frankenberg, a town near Marburg. They are called Barber's pear, from
 a certain barber who first introduced them there.

 "_Hangelbirn_, that is, Hanging pear, are equal to the Butter in
 shape, color, and size; they hang from a long stalk, whence they have
 received their name; in flavor they differ from the Butter, for their
 juice is not so winey nor so acid; they have a simpler flavor, not
 composed of so many qualities. However, they ripen at the same time.
 These too are cultivated in Hesse.

 "_Margarethenbirn_, that is, Margaret's pear, are so called because
 they become ripe about St. Margaret's Day, when the sun is entering
 into Leo. They end in an oblong neck; in length they reach three
 inches, in width hardly two inches. They have a reddish-blue color.
 Their pulp is tender and juicy, of very sweet taste, easily melting in
 the mouth; they have a very pleasant smell. They abound at Brunswick
 in Saxony.

 "_Winterbirn_, that is, Winter pear, from a round shape become
 slightly conical; they are less than three inches in length, little
 more than two inches in breadth. They have a green color, a very hard
 substance, so that they scarcely give way to the teeth. In taste they
 are very acid and refreshing, quenching the thirst with a watery, sour
 juice. They ripen late in autumn after all other fruits, after they
 have been touched with frosts and cold. They are found at Frankenberg
 in Hesse.

 "_Knochenbirn_, that is, Bone pear, have received their name from
 their hardness; from a swelling belly they end gradually in a short
 and narrow neck. They rarely exceed two inches in length and an inch
 and a half in breadth. They have a light reddish color; they are of
 such hard substance that they cannot be chewed raw but only when
 cooked. They have a very acid taste. They ripen at the beginning of
 autumn. They are cultivated at Frankenberg in Hesse.

 "_Augustbirn_, that is, August pear, would be almost round except that
 they end in a short point. Their length is a little more than two
 inches, their width a little less. They have a yellow color, at times
 turning to pale red. In taste they are acid, with a peculiar sweetness
 of juice. They ripen early in August, whence they have received
 their name. They are short-lived and do not last long. They abound
 everywhere in Hesse.

 "_Honigbirn gross_, that is, Honey pear, large, end in an oblong cone:
 they are two inches and a half in length, but in breadth hardly reach
 two inches. They have a bluish-gray color verging on yellow, and a
 surface not so smooth; in taste they are acid and abound in sweet
 juice; they ripen at the beginning of autumn, lasting for a while.
 They are found at Wittenberg in upper Saxony.

 "_Honigbirn klein_, that is, Honey pear, small, are of conical shape,
 in length do not exceed an inch and a half, in width are a little
 less; they have a light reddish color, a flavor very sweet and
 pleasant, whence they have received their name. They melt readily in
 the mouth of those who taste them. They ripen soon after the August
 pear. They abound in Hesse.

 "_Muscatellerbirn_, that is, Musk pear, are very small and conical, in
 length a little more than an inch, in width a little less. Their color
 is green tinged with red, their taste most sweet and aromatic, as if
 it were flavored with a little musk, whence their name. They easily
 melt in the mouth; they have also a pleasing odor. They ripen in June.
 They are carefully cultivated in Meissen.

 "_Schaffbirn_, that is, Sheep pear, are like the larger Honey in size,
 shape and color, but a little more oblong and narrow. They have a very
 sweet flavor, moderately astringent, and easily dissolve in the mouth
 on account of the tender softness of their pulp and juice. They ripen
 when the sun is hastening toward Libra. They are found in Frankenberg
 in Hesse.

 "_Waxbirn_, that is, Wax pear, are big-bellied at the lower end, at
 the upper end taper off into a cone; in length sometimes exceed three
 inches by a little, but in width rarely exceed two inches. They have
 a yellow or wax-like color, whence their name has been given them,
 but on that side where they have received the sun they invite those
 who look upon them to eat them by their pleasing, speckled redness.
 They have a sweet flavor, slightly astringent; their pulp is soft and
 easily melts in the mouth. They ripen when the sun has entered Virgo;
 they are short-lived and do not last long. They are found at Marburg
 in Hesse.

 "_Rostbirn_, that is, Rust pear, are big-bellied in the middle and
 narrow down at both ends; in length three inches and a half, in
 width two inches and a half. They have a yellow color, speckled with
 bluish-gray spots; they have a very mild, sweet flavor, and easily
 melt in the mouth; because of their extreme softness they last a very
 short time. They ripen at the beginning of autumn. They are cultivated
 at Eisleben and neighboring towns.

 "_Aschbirn_, that is, Ash pear, have their name because they are
 soft like ashes and easily dissolve in the mouth. They resemble the
 Rust pear in shape, color, quality of pulp, and flavor; but are a
 little smaller, and more conical at one end toward the stalk, though
 sometimes they become big-bellied in the middle like the Rust. They
 ripen with the Rust. They are cultivated at Eisleben.

 "_Drinkebirn_, that is, Drink pear, are so called because like a drink
 they drive away anybody's thirst. They are swollen in the middle and
 end in a blunt point; in length a little over two inches, in width
 scarcely two inches. Their color is wholly yellow, but they redden
 on that side which is exposed to the sun; they have a sweet flavor,
 tender pulp, abounding with copious and drinkable juice. They ripen
 with the Rust and quickly decay just as they do. They are cultivated
 in the country near Eisleben.

 "_Eyerbirn_, that is, Egg pear, have received their name from
 their shape, which becomes conical at both ends like a short egg;
 otherwise they do not differ much from the Drink pear in proportion
 and shape. They are, however, a little smaller, have a yellow color
 speckled with dots. In flavor they rival the Rust and like them are
 moderately astringent; they have a very sweet fragrance, ripen with
 the Drink pear, and quickly decay. They too are found at Eisleben and
 neighboring towns.

 "_Pfaltzgräuischbirn_ (Palatinate grayish-pear), that is, Palatina,
 which are called Mass pear in Hesse, are the most excellent of the
 short-lived ones, and in like manner generally end in a cone; in
 length they reach two inches and a half, in width rarely exceed two
 inches. Their color is mid-way between saffron and reddish purple.
 They have a tender, juicy pulp, an exceptionally sweet flavor,
 aromatic as it were. They have a most pleasing fragrance both when
 they are whole and when they are cut, surpassed in excellence by no
 other variety of pear. They ripen at the end of August, when the sun
 has entered Virgo. They are found in the Rhine Valley, in France,
 Hesse, and many other regions.

 "_Spindelbirn_ or _Rautenbirn_ (Rhombus pear), that is, Spindle pear,
 are like the Rust in shape, color, and size, but a little narrower;
 in substance and flavor they differ from them, since they consist of
 harder pulp and so last longer; they have a flavor astringent and at
 the same time sweet. They ripen with the Rust, and are cultivated in
 the country about Eisleben.

 "_Zuckerbirn_, that is, Sugar pear, are a little more than two inches
 in length, rarely as much in width; of greenish color; they have a
 tender pulp, melting easily in the mouth like sugar, sweet and of
 pleasant flavor. They ripen with the Egg pear and do not last long.
 They are cultivated in the country about Eisleben.

 "_Packelemischbirn_, that is, Paclemiana, are like the Sugar in size
 and shape; their color is green and bluish-gray; their surface is
 rather rough, their pulp hard, juicy, and acid. They ripen with the
 Sugar, and if they receive no injury they do not easily decay, but may
 last for some time, as most others do which have hard pulp and acid
 taste. They are cultivated in the country about Eisleben.

 "_Kirchmessbirn_, that is, Church Mass pear, are round and
 big-bellied, and end toward the stalk in a long, narrow, and much
 attenuated point. In length they are three and a half inches, in
 breadth over two inches, though even smaller ones are produced. They
 are yellow in color, tender and juicy in pulp, and like the Palatina
 and Drink in flavor. They ripen in autumn and last almost until the
 sun enters Sagittarius. They are found at Wittemberg.

 "_Knaustbirn_ or _Gelbe Honigbirn_ (Yellow Honey pear), that is,
 Bread Crust pear, have a broad base and are swollen and almost round,
 toward the stalk ending in a short, blunt, and rounded point; both in
 length and in breadth they sometimes exceed two inches and a half,
 but rarely; they are of yellow color, speckled generally around the
 bottom; they resemble the larger Honey in color and acidity; their
 pulp is rather hard but juicy, stony around the seed-receptacles. They
 have a flavor between that of the larger Honey and the Lion and that
 very pleasing. They ripen in autumn and sometimes last almost to the
 winter solstice. They are cultivated at Wittemberg and neighboring
 places.

 "_Klosterbirn_, that is, Cloister pear, swell out with uneven belly
 and toward the stalk become conical; they reach three inches in length
 and not much less in breadth. They have a yellow color, speckled with
 green dots; their pulp is rather hard and somewhat stony; their taste
 mildly astringent and of slightly glutinous sweetness. They ripen with
 the Bread Crust pear and last as long. They are found in the country
 about Wittemberg.

 "_Glassbirn_, that is, Glass pear, are round and slightly conical;
 in length they generally reach two and one-third inches, in breadth
 a little over two inches; their color is light green verging on
 yellow; their flesh is tender, juicy, astringent to the taste, sweet
 and winey; they ripen with the Rust a little before the beginning of
 autumn. There is an abundant crop of them at Eisleben and neighboring
 towns. They last until the sun enters Sagittarius.

 "_Kirchbirn_, that is, Church pear, have an oblong oval shape but
 end in a cone rather than an oval. They reach two inches in length,
 in width somewhat exceed an inch and a half. Their color is on one
 side yellowish-green, on the other, where they have received the sun,
 reddish. Their pulp is hard, rather juicy, slightly sour to the taste,
 and very astringent. They ripen at the end of summer and last for a
 long time. Of these too there is an abundant crop at Eisleben.

 "_Quittenbirn_, that is, Quince pear, like the Cloister pear, swell
 out with uneven belly, and toward the stalk end in a short point,
 like the conical Cotonea, but protuberant ones are also found, whence
 the name was given them. In breadth as well as length they exceed
 two inches and a third. They have a green color, a hard, juicy pulp,
 rather winey and astringent to the taste. They ripen at the beginning
 of autumn and last till the winter. They are found at Eisleben.

 "_Parissbirn_, that is, Parisiana, are round at the lower end and
 taper to a point at the upper end. Their length is two and a half
 inches, their width not over two inches, or rarely more. Their color
 on one side is yellow, but on the other, where they have felt the sun,
 purple. Their pulp is juicy, their taste pleasantly astringent. They
 ripen with those before mentioned, lasting into the winter. There is
 an abundant crop of them in the country about Eisleben.

 "_Weybersterbenbirn_, that is, Women's Death pear, would be round,
 except that toward the stalk they end in a short, blunt point. They
 generally exceed two inches in breadth as well as in length. They have
 a yellow color, saffron towards the base, speckled with purple dots.
 Their pulp is hard and rather stony, with juice slightly sour to the
 taste and very astringent, like the Church pear, with which also they
 ripen. They last into the winter. They are cultivated in the country
 about Eisleben.

 "_Kölbirn_, that is, Cabbage pear, are large, almost round, tapering
 to a cone, three inches in length and one-half to one-third of an
 inch less in breadth. They have a pale green color, one side slightly
 reddish and speckled with dots. Their pulp is rather hard, juicy,
 somewhat sour and very astringent to the taste, like the Women's Death
 pear, with which also they ripen, and they last as long. They are
 cultivated at Eisleben.

 "_Hölpenerbirn_, that is, Hollow pear, are large, big-bellied, uneven,
 and conical; in length they sometimes exceed two and a half inches,
 in width almost equal their length. Their color is green; they have a
 juicy pulp, winey in taste, slightly acid, and more astringent than
 the Brassicana. They ripen at the beginning of autumn, and last long
 into the winter. There is a large crop of them in the country about
 Eisleben.

 "_Safftbirn_, that is, Sap pear, are like the Hollow pear but a little
 smaller and less uneven, of a greenish-yellow color; their pulp is
 solid and when cut sheds a copious juice, when chewed passes almost
 wholly into juice and very little dry substance remains; when the
 juice is swallowed, it is cool to the taste, somewhat acid, winey, and
 astringent. They ripen at the beginning of autumn and last for a long
 time. They are found at Wittemberg.

 "_Eierlingebirn_, that is, Little-egg pear, have received their name
 from their oval shape; in shape and size they are midway between the
 Drink and the Egg pear; their color is yellow, speckled with reddish
 dots on a dark background. They have hard, juicy pulp, acid to the
 taste, winey, and astringent. They ripen at the beginning of autumn
 and last for a long time. They grow at Wittemberg.

 "_Kruselbirn_, that is, Curling pear, in shape resemble a top which
 boys throw upon the ground wound up with a string to make it spin. In
 length they reach three inches, in width two and a half. Their color
 is pale green, speckled with many green dots or spots; their pulp
 is solid, juicy, very astringent to the taste, somewhat acid and
 pleasant. They last until the sun has passed Aquarius or Pisces. They
 abound in Meissen.

 "_Bratbirn gross_, also called _Fregelbirn_, that is, pears for
 roasting, are about the largest of all, for sometimes they weigh a
 mina (about 15.2 ounces) and a half; they are of globular shape,
 sometimes conical, and frequently irregular; of a color midway between
 pale green and red, redder on one side. They have a pulp with pleasant
 juice, astringent, partaking somewhat of acid. They grow in Meissen,
 especially at Leisnig and Koldit.

 "_Grauchenbirn_, that is, Gray pear, have received their name from
 their color, since they are ash-colored and at the same time greenish.
 They are small and of globular shape, measuring an inch in breadth as
 well as in length; in appearance are in no way different from some
 of the wild pears; in taste are soft, mild, sweet, with a pleasantly
 astringent quality; they last till after the winter solstice. They
 grow in the country about Meissen and Leipzig.

 "_Gelbrotebirn_, that is, Yellow-red pear, have an oblong pyramidal
 shape, generally reaching a length of three inches, and a width of
 two inches. Their color on one side is yellow, on the other saffron
 and purple; their pulp is soft, astringent to the taste, pleasant,
 slightly acid, and watery. They ripen at the beginning of autumn, and
 last till the winter solstice. They grow at Hildesheim in Saxony.

 "_Grünlingebirn_, that is, Green pear, are quite large, since
 sometimes they exceed three inches in length, two inches in breadth;
 they have an oblong pyramidal shape, a green color, a juicy pulp,
 sharply astringent to the taste. They ripen at the beginning of
 autumn, and last till after the solstice. There is a large crop of
 them at Hildesheim.

 "_Wasserbirn_, that is, Water pear, rival Green pear in size, they
 have a shape big-bellied in the middle and taper to a point at both
 ends, sharper and more oblong toward the stem, but shorter and blunter
 near the base. Their color on one side is pale, speckled with dots, on
 the other reddish, pale on the edges. They have juicy pulp, watery and
 rather pleasant to the taste. They become ripe with the Green pear but
 do not last so long. They grow at Hildesheim.

 "_Kegelbirn_, that is, Cone pear, have the shape of a pine cone, and
 from a rather broad base end in a point; their length is three inches,
 their width two; their color on one side green, on the other reddish.
 Their pulp is juicy, harsh to the taste. Their maturity falls at the
 beginning of autumn, from which time they may last till the winter
 solstice. They are produced at Hildesheim."


                          THE PEAR IN ENGLAND

Much as America owes England for fruit, farm, and garden crops, she
is but little indebted to her for pears. Varieties of pears have come
to the New World almost wholly from Belgium and France, not more
than three or four major sorts of English origin being among those
now commonly grown in America. But even though the line of march in
the development of varieties scarcely touches England, all English
speaking pear-growers have received instruction as to culture and have
had knowledge of continental varieties transmitted to them through
English publications. In the history of fruits in England, therefore,
many gleams of light illuminate the path along which the pear has been
brought from the ancients to America.

No doubt the pear was brought to Britain before the Roman conquest.
Tacitus, in the first century, says the climate of Britain is suitable
to the culture of all fruits and vegetables except the grape and the
olive. Pliny writes that the Britains had the cherry before the middle
of the first century, and almost certainly the pear and other fruits
were introduced with it. There was, also, a Saxon name for the pear,
_pirige_, so philologists say, before the fall of the Roman Empire. The
years 43 and 407 mark the beginning and the end of the Romans and of
civilization in Britain for many centuries, and whether or not the pear
was permanently established during this time there are now no means
of ascertaining. The climate and soil of England are congenial to the
pear, however, and no doubt wild or little cultivated trees persisted
until the Norman conquest, the spread of Christianity, and the building
of many monasteries with orchards and gardens as essential adjuncts.

Even in England under the Normans who came in 1066, not much progress
was made in fruit-growing. Tillers of the soil were hard pressed for
the necessities of life and could only with difficulty harvest a
bare sustenance from the land. Besides, monks and nobles preyed on
the starving peasants so that at no time could the farmer be sure of
reaping what he planted. Only these monks and nobles enjoyed luxuries.
But even men who boasted of titles and owned large holdings of land
had little room within fortified walls and on moated islands, which
constant wars made necessary, for fruits; nor had they time from
projects of war and the pleasures of the chase to devote to the art of
agriculture. Fortunately, priors and abbots were well disposed toward
the good things of life, therefore made much of fruits and vegetables,
and with abundance of leisure the monks became the only proficients of
the times in gardening and orcharding. Moreover, they were in constant
correspondence with the continent and could ascertain what culture was
needed to grow perfect fruits. Pear culture had its beginnings in
England, then, in the monasteries established under the Normans.

Pressed for an exact date as to when the pear began to be cultivated
in England, the historians would be troubled to name one. There is a
plan of the monastery of Canterbury made in 1165 which shows an orchard
and a vineyard. History, moreover, relates that armed men collected in
an orchard to take hand in the murder of Thomas Becket in 1170. Men in
those days set small store by written accounts, and history must be
helped out by imagination, and we may imagine that there were pears in
this orchard.

Pears by this time had become common, for there are records of
varieties to a considerable number and in large quantities which could
have been had only from rather extensive orchards. Mrs. Evelyn Cecil[5]
publishes documents from the Record office of England which contain
items of pears bought for Henry III and Edward I at different times in
the thirteenth century, the first date being "probably for the year
1223." The pears appear to be of French origin, and the varieties are
Caloels, Pesse Pesceles, Ruler, and Martyns. In a later memorandum,
1292-93, still other varieties are named as the Regul, Calwel, Dieyer,
Sorell, Chryfall, and Gold Knoper. The pears were sold by the hundred
and were used for desert, though "pears in syrup" and pears for cider
are mentioned. The perusal of these documents, printed in considerable
detail in Mrs. Cecil's admirable book, enables us to fix the beginning
of commercial pear culture in England at as early a date as 1200.

Passing by several other references from records and financial accounts
of monasteries in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries as too vague to
be of importance, although they make certain that the pear was rather
widely cultivated in England in these two centuries, we come at last
to a noteworthy landmark in pear history in England, the introduction
of the Warden pear, which may be put at the conveniently vague date of
the end of the fourteenth century, 1388 being the first year they are
mentioned.

"Warden" was a name used for centuries to designate a group of pear
varieties having crisp, firm flesh and which were used for culinary
purposes. Their history runs back to the Cistercian Abbey of Warden
in Bedfordshire and to a date earlier than 1388. Warden pears were
favorites for centuries for pies and pastries which every early
cook-book contained recipes for making. In the early English literature
they are considered a distinct fruit as "apples, pears, quinces,
wardens," and even the herbals and early fruit books count them as
distinct. Shakespeare's clown in _A Winter's Tale_ says: "I must have
saffron to colour the Warden pies." The name came to signify any
long-keeping, cooking pear and even yet is so used in parts of England.

The most noteworthy landmark is found in the discussions of pears by
the English herbalists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Turner, the first of these herbalists, in his _Herbal_ of 1551,
mentions the pear but without important details, though we may infer
from what he says that the pear is now a common fruit. Thomas Tusser,
in his _Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandrie_, published in 1573,
gives a list of fruits to be set or removed in January in which he
includes "pears of all sorts," and then as a separate item includes
"Warden, white and red," showing that "Wardens" were held as distinct
from the pear and that they were prominent in the orchards of the time.
The century ends with John Gerarde's _Herball or Generall Historie
of Plantes_, 1597, in which we are brought to the realization that
the pear is no longer a probationary fruit or even to be considered
a novelty or luxury but a standard food product. Gerarde might well
be quoted in full, but since Parkinson, a few years later, contains a
"fuller discourse," as one of Gerarde's editors says, we take but a few
sentences from Gerarde.

Varieties by this time had become numerous. Gerarde, while he names
but eight, says he knew someone who grew "at the point of three score
sundrie sorts of Peares, and those exceeding good; not doubting but
that if his minde had beene to seeke after multitudes he might have
gotten together the like number of those worse kindes ... to describe
each pear apart, were to send an owle to Athens, or to number those
things without number." Eight sorts are considered worth figuring,
those accorded the honor being: "the Jenneting, Saint James, Royall,
Beugomot, Quince, Bishop, Katherine, and the Winter Peare." Of these
the Katherine is given further prominence by being listed as "known to
all." If one is to judge from number of varieties, the pear at this
time is a more general favorite than the apple, a considerably greater
number of sorts being indicated.

Parkinson's account in his _Paradisus_ of 1629, indeed does prove to be
a "fuller discourse" for he names and describes 65 sorts; but these are
not all for he says: "The variety of peares is as much or more then of
apples, and I thinke it is as hard in this, as before in apples, for
any to be so exquisite, as that hee could number up all the sorts that
are to be had: for wee have in our country so manie, as I shall give
you the names of by and by, and are hitherto come to our knowledge:
but I verily beleeve that there be many, both in our country, and in
others, that we have not yet knowne or heard of; for every yeare almost
wee attaine to the knowledge of some, we knew not of before. Take
therefore, according to the manner before held, the description of one,
with the severall names of the rest, untill a more exact discourse be
had of them, every one apart." Some of the names in Parkinson's list
are group names covering several varieties. Thus, he says, "the Winter
Bon Chretien is of many sorts;" and again, "the Winter Bergomot is of
two or three sorts;" and, "the Winter peare is of many sorts."

Parkinson's descriptions are brief but written with rare clearness, and
the old herbalist seems to have possessed a nicety of observation that
commends him to all who have eyes for the distinguishing characters of
fruits. With Parkinson our history of the pear in England must come to
a close, since later accounts are available to all, and therefore as an
important inventory, and because every word is pertinent, his account
of varieties is republished.

 "The Summer bon Chretien is somewhat a long peare, with a greene and
 yellow russetish coate, and will have sometimes red sides; it is ripe
 at Michaelmas: Some use to dry them as they doe Prunes, and keepe them
 all the yeare after. I have not seene or heard any more Summer kindes
 hereof then this one, and needeth no wall to nourse it as the other.

 "The Winter bon Chretien is of many sorts, some greater, others
 lesser, and all good; but the greatest and best is that kinde that
 groweth at Syon: All the kinds of this Winter fruit must be planted
 against a wall, or else they will both seldome beare, and bring fewer
 also to ripenesse, comparable to the wall fruit: The kindes also are
 according to their lasting; for some will endure good much longer than
 others.

 "The Summer Bergomot is an excellent well rellished peare, flattish,
 & short, not long like others, of a meane bignesse, and of a darke
 yellowish greene colour on the outside.

 "The Winter Bergomot is of two or three sorts, being all of them small
 fruit, somewhat greener on the outside then the Summer kindes; all
 of them very delicate and good in their due time: For some will not
 be fit to bee eaten when others are well-nigh spent, every of them
 outlasting another by a moneth or more.

 "The Diego peare is but a small peare, but an excellent well rellished
 fruit, tasting as if Muske had been put among it; many of them growe
 together, as it were in clusters.

 "The Duetete or double headed peare, so called of the forme, is a
 very good peare, not very great, of a russettish browne colour on the
 outside.

 "The Primating peare is a good moist peare, and early ripe.

 "The Geneting peare is a very good early ripe peare.

 "The greene Chesill is a delicate mellow peare, even melting as it
 were in the mouth of the eater, although greenish on the outside.

 "The Catherine peare is knowne to all I thinke to be a yellow red
 sided peare, of a full waterish sweete taste, and ripe with the
 foremost.

 "The King Catherine is greater than the other, and of the same
 goodnesse, or rather better.

 "The Russet Catherine is a very good middle sized peare.

 "The Windsor peare is an excellent good peare, well knowne to most
 persons, and of a reasonable greatnesse: it will beare fruit some
 times twice in a yeare (and as it is said) three times in some places.

 "The Norwich peare is of two sorts, Summer and Winter, both of them
 good fruit, each in their season.

 "The Worster peare is blackish, a farre better peare to bake (when as
 it will be like a Warden, and as good) than to eate rawe; yet so it is
 not to be misliked.

 "The Muske peare is like unto a Catherine peare for bignesse, colour,
 and forme; but farre more excellent in taste, as the very name
 importeth.

 "The Rosewater peare is a goodly faire peare, and of a delicate taste.

 "The Sugar peare is an early peare, very sweete, but waterish.

 "The Summer Popperin  } both of them are very good dry firme peares,
                       } somewhat spotted, and brownish on the
 "The Winter Popperin  } outside.

 "The greene Popperin is a winter fruit, of equall goodnesse with the
 former.

 "The Soveraigne peare, that which I have seene and tasted, and so
 termed unto me, was a small brownish yellow peare, but of a most
 dainty taste; but some doe take a kind of Bon Chretien, called the
 Elizabeth peare, to be the Soveraigne peare; how truely let others
 judge.

 "The Kings peare is a very good and well tasted peare.

 "The peare Royall is a great peare, and of a good rellish.

 "The Warwicke peare is a reasonable faire and good peare.

 "The Greenfield peare is a very good peare, of a middle size.

 "The Lewes peare is a brownish greene peare, ripe about the end of
 September, a resonable well rellished fruit, and very moist.

 "The Bishop peare is a middle sized peare, of a reasonable good taste,
 not very waterish; but this property is oftentimes seene in it, that
 before the fruit is gathered, (but more usually those that fall of
 themselves, and the rest within a while after they are gathered) will
 be rotten at the core, when there will not be a spot or blemish to
 bee seene on the outside, or in all the peare, untill you come neare
 the core.

 "The Wilford peare is a good and a faire peare.

 "The Bell peare a very good greene peare.

 "The Portingall peare is a great peare, but more goodly in shew than
 good indeed.

 "The Gratiola peare is a kinde of Bon Chretien, called the Cowcumber
 peare, or Spinola's peare.

 "The Rowling peare is a good peare, but hard, and not good before it
 bee a little rowled or bruised, to make it eate the more mellow.

 "The Pimpe peare is as great as the Windsor peare, but rounder, and of
 a very good rellish.

 "The Turnep peare is a hard winter peare, not so good to eate rawe, as
 it is to bake.

 "The Arundell peare is most plentifull in Suffolke, and there
 commended to be a verie good peare.

 "The Berry peare is a Summer peare, reasonable faire and great, and of
 so good and wholesome a taste, that few or none take harme by eating
 never so many of them.

 "The Sand peare is a reasonable good peare, but small.

 "The Morley peare is a very good peare, like in forme and colour unto
 the Windsor, but somewhat grayer.

 "The peare pricke is very like unto the Greenfield peare, being both
 faire, great, and good.

 "The good Rewell is a reasonable great peare, as good to bake as to
 eate rawe, and both wayes it is a good fruit.

 "The Hawkes Bill peare is of a middle size, somewhat like unto the
 Rowling peare.

 "The Petworth peare is a winter peare, and is great, somewhat long,
 faire, and good.

 "The Slipper peare is a reasonable good peare.

 "The Robert peare is a very good peare, plentiful in Suffolke and
 Norfolke.

 "The Pound peare is a reasonable good peare, both to eate rawe, and to
 bake.

 "The Ten Pound peare, or the hundred pound peare, the truest and best,
 is the best Bon Chretien of Syon, so called, because the grafts cost
 the Master so much the fetching by the messengers expences, when he
 brought nothing else.

 "The Gilloflower peare is a winter peare, faire in shew, but hard, and
 not fit to bee eaten rawe, but very good to bake.

 "The peare Couteau is neither good one way nor other.

 colour, and a small fruit: but will abide good a long while.

 "The Pucell is a greene peare, of an indifferent good taste.

 pleasant taste.

 "The white Genneting is a reasonable good peare, yet not equall to the
 other.

 "The Sweater is somewhat like the Windsor for colour and bignesse, but
 nothing neare of so good a taste.

 "The bloud red peare is of a darke red colour on the outside, but
 piercing very little into the inner pulpe.

 "The Hony peare is a long greene Summer peare.

 "The Winter peare is of many sorts, but this is onely so called, to
 bee distinguished from all other Winter peares, which have severall
 names given them, and is a very good peare.

 "The Warden or Luke Wards peare of two sorts, both white and red, both
 great and small.

 "The Spanish Warden is greater than either of both the former, and
 better also.

 "The peare of Jerusalem, or the stript peare, whose barke while it is
 young, is as plainly seene to be stript with greene, red, and yellow,
 as the fruit it selfe is also, and is of a very good taste: being
 baked also, it is as red as the best Warden, whereof Master William
 Ward of Essex hath assured mee, who is the chiefe keeper of the Kings
 Granary at Whitehall.

 "Hereof likewise there is a wilde kinde no bigger than ones thumbe,
 and striped in the like manner, but much more.

 "The Choke peares, and other wilde peares, both great and small, as
 they are not to furnish our Orchard, but the Woods, Forrests, Fields,
 and Hedges, so wee leave them to their naturall places, and to them
 that keep them, and make good use of them."

Three hundred years have played havoc with the pears Parkinson knew.
None are known in America, and unless the Pound of Parkinson is the
Pound of today, not a half dozen are found in current lists in England.
Parkinson's Catherine, Winter Bon Chretien, Windsor, Bergamot, possibly
the Pound, and his Gergonell, the Jargonelle of today, are about all
the names that would be recognized by modern pear-growers. The pear
shows far fewer familiar names at the end of three centuries than
Parkinson lists of apples, plums, cherries, or even the peach in
Europe. Dropping old varieties can only be interpreted as improvement
in the pear. The pear, it seems certain, has been more profoundly
changed for the better through the touch of man's hand than the other
fruits named since Parkinson wrote. For this, pomology has the Belgians
to thank.

Pear culture seems to have reached its height, if it be judged by
its literature and by the number of varieties cultivated, early in
the nineteenth century. The Belgians' passion for pears was no doubt
the chief stimulus, for the Belgian breeders spread their offerings
with generous hand throughout England. In 1826, the catalog of the
Horticultural Society of London listed 622 pears. Pomology in England
was then, and is now as compared with America, an art of the leisure
classes. This has been an advantage and a disadvantage to the pear
in England. The advantage is that when fruit is grown for pleasure
many varieties are grown to add novelty to luxury so that the fruit
is thereby more rapidly improved and its culture brought to greater
perfection. The disadvantage is that those who grow fruit for market
find a poorer market for their wares since those who should be their
best customers supply their own wants. For the reason, therefore, that
the English take delight in growing their own fruit, pear-growing is
not the great commercial enterprise that it is in America.

Pear-growing in England differs from that of America in another
respect. The pear-tree in England is built as much as planted. In many
plantations each tree has a precise architectural form. The plants
are trained into fans, cordons, espaliers and u-forms on walls; or as
pyramids, globes, or vases in the open; sometimes in fantastic shapes
to suit the fancy of the grower; and now and then as a hedge or border.
The undisciplined standards of America are hardly known, though what
the English call a standard seems to be increasing. This difference in
training is due in part to the necessity of meeting different climatic
conditions, and in part to greater devotion on the Englishman's part
to the art of gardening--the use of the shears, the knife, and the
billhook give the gardener greater scope. The pear-tree in England is
often decorative as well as useful.


                          THE PEAR IN AMERICA

The pear is a popular fruit in America, but its culture as a commercial
product is limited to a few favored localities. From the earliest
records of fruit-growing in America the pear has been grown less than
the apple and peach and scarcely more than the cherry and plum.
In Europe, it is a question if the pear is not more commonly grown
than the apple, and is much more common than the plum and the peach,
the last-named fruit being grown out of doors for most part only in
southern Europe. Pears are more varied in size, shape, texture, and
flavor of flesh than others of the hardy tree-fruits, and in length
of season exceed all others excepting the apple. Varieties of pears,
possibly, have the charm of individuality more marked than varieties
of its orchard associates. The trees, where environment permits their
culture, are not difficult to grow, and attain greater size, produce
larger crops, and live longer than any other hardy fruit. Why, then,
is the pear not more popular in America? Conditions of climate,
pests, season of ripening, taste, and trade prevent the expansion of
pear-culture on this side of the Atlantic.

The climate in most parts of America is uncongenial to the pear. Pears
from the European stock, to which most varieties grown in America
belong, thrive only in relatively equable climates, and do not endure
well the sudden and extreme variations in climate to which most parts
of this continent are subject. Extremes of heat or cold, wetness or
dryness, are fatal to the pear. In North America, therefore, commercial
pear-culture is confined to favored localities on the Atlantic
seaboard, about the Great Lakes, and on the Pacific slope. Even in
these favored regions, pears sent to market come largely from the
plantations of specialists. On the Atlantic seaboard, European pears
are products of commerce only in southern New England and New York,
westward through Ohio on the shores of Lake Erie, and in the southern
lake regions of Michigan. Away from these bodies of water to the
Pacific, varieties of European pears refuse to grow except with the
utmost care in culture and selection of sites. On the Pacific slope,
in the hardy-fruit regions, the pear reaches its highest development
in the New World. Oriental pears, or varieties having Oriental blood,
as Kieffer and Le Conte, are grown in every part of America where the
culture of hardy fruits is attempted.

Liability to loss by pests is a great detriment to the popularity
of the pear in America. The insect pests of pears are numerous.
Codling-moths attack the fruit wherever the pear is grown in America,
and can be kept down only by expensive arsenical sprays. The psylla,
while irregular in its outbreaks, is most damaging and hard to control
when it appears. These are the chief insect enemies, but a dozen
others take more or less toll from tree or fruit. Foliage and fruit
are attacked by several parasitic fungi, of which pear-scab is most
troublesome, requiring treatment wherever the pear is grown, and under
favorable conditions for the fungus preventives often fail to give
the fruits a fair cheek. But of all diseases pear-blight is the most
serious, its effects and virulency being such as to give it the popular
name "fire-blight." It is caused by a bacterium which cannot be checked
by sprays, and must be combatted with expensive and unsatisfactory
sanitary measures, such as cutting out branches and trees, so drastic
as to make impossible commercial cultivation of pears in regions where
climate favors the disease.

Pears compete with apples more than with any other fruit, but are at a
disadvantage with this near relative in having a much shorter period
during which the fruits can be used. Varieties of the two fruits begin
to ripen at nearly the same season, but there are few sorts of pears in
season later than December, and these are of poorer quality than the
fall varieties; while apples are abundant and of prime quality four or
five months later, and may be kept until early apples usher in a new
season. During most of its season, also, the pear must compete with
the perishable summer and autumn plums and peaches, so luscious and
delectable that the firmer and less highly flavored pome-fruits suffer
in comparison.

Still another reason why the pear is not a popular dessert fruit in
America is that, of all fruits, the varieties of this one are the most
variable in quality of the product. Sorts that should produce pears of
highest quality bear fruits poor or indifferent in texture and flavor
in unfavorable seasons, on unsuitable soils, or under neglect. Good
pears can be grown only when environmental factors are favorable and
under the most generous treatment. Extensive cultivation of the Kieffer
and its kin for canning has hindered the cultivation of pears for the
fruit-stand and to grace the table as a dessert fruit. So common has
the Kieffer become that many of the present generation are hardly aware
that the pear may be a delicious fruit to eat out of hand.

Lastly, the pear falls short of the apple as a commercial product
because it is not nearly so satisfactory to handle as a commercial
crop. Pears are more difficult to pack, and do not stand transportation
as well as apples. They cannot be kept in cold storage nearly as
long, and decay more quickly when brought into warmer temperatures.
The demand for evaporated pears is slight in comparison with that for
evaporated apples, and although perry, the expressed juice of pears, is
quite as refreshing as cider, this by-product of the fruit is little
known in America. As a prepared product, the pear surpasses the apple
only as a canned fruit. Failing in comparison with the apple, as a
commercial product, pears are largely left to fruit connoisseurs,
and with these a generation ago the pear was the fruit of fruits,
many splendid collections of it having been made in regions where
pears could be grown. With the expansion of commercial fruit-growing,
collections of pears, and with them many choice varieties, have gone
out of cultivation--more is the pity--and pear-growing has expanded
least of all the fruit industries in the United States.

With this brief discussion of the present status of pear-culture in
this country, we can proceed to trace the history of the pear with
more exactness by reason of knowing its limitations under American
conditions.

The peach is the only hardy fruit that belongs to the heroic age of
Spanish discovery in the New World. Pears, apples, plums, and cherries
came to the new continent with the French and English. The early
records of fruit-growing in America show that the pear came among
the first luxuries of the land in the French and English settlements
from Canada to Florida. Pioneers in any country begin at once to
cultivate the soil for the means of sustenance. Naturally, cereals and
easily-grown nutritious vegetables receive attention first as giving
more immediate harvests and more sustaining fare to supplement game
and fish. Agriculture and gardening usually precede orcharding, and
this was the case in early settlements in America, but not long. The
first generation born in colonial America knew and used all of the
hardy fruits from Europe; as many records attest, and of which there is
confirmatory proof with the pear in many ancient pear-trees of great
size near the old settlements, some of which were planted by the first
settlers from Europe. Of pears, many notable trees planted by the
hands of the first English and French who crossed the seas to settle
the new country were conspicuous monuments in various parts of America
in the memory of men still living, if, indeed, some of the old trees
themselves are not still standing.

Of these ancient pear-trees, New England furnishes the most notable
monuments to mark the introduction of this fruit in the New World.
Fortunately, their histories have been preserved in several
horticultural annals, and of these accounts the fullest and best is by
Robert Manning, Jr., in the Proceedings of the American Pomological
Society for 1875, pages 100 to 103. Manning's notes throw so much light
on the early history of the pear in New England, as well as upon the
varieties then grown, that they are published in full.

 "The _Endicott_ Pear. The tradition in the Endicott family is that
 this tree was planted in 1630. It is said that the trees constituting
 the original orchard came over from England in June, in the Arabella
 with Governor Winthrop, or in one of the other ships of the fleet
 arriving at Salem in June. The farm on which the tree now stands, not
 having been granted to Endicott until 1632, it is not probable that
 the trees were planted there before that time, but they might have
 been at first set in the Governor's town garden at Salem, where the
 Rev. Francis Higginson, on his arrival in the summer of 1629, found
 a vine-yard already planted. The tradition further states that the
 Governor said that the tree was of the same date with a sun-dial which
 formerly stood near it. This dial, after having passed through the
 hands of the Rev. William Bentley, D.D., is now in the Essex Institute
 in Salem, and bears the date 1630, with the Governor's initials.
 The farm, which early bore the name of 'Orchard,' was occupied and
 cultivated by the Governor and his descendants for 184 years, from
 1632 to 1816, and was held solely by the original grant until 1828,
 a period of 196 years. Under these circumstances the history of the
 tree is more likely to have been handed down correctly than if the
 estate had changed hands. It is certain that Governor Endicott was
 early engaged in propagating trees, for in a letter to John Winthrop
 in 1644, he speaks of having at least 500 trees burnt by his children
 setting fire near them, and, in a letter to John Winthrop, Jr., a year
 later, of being engaged to pay for 1500 trees.

 "As early as 1763 the tree was very old and decayed. It was very
 much injured in the gale of 1804. In the gale of 1815 it was so much
 shattered that its recovery was considered doubtful. It was injured
 again in a gale about 1843. For the last fifty years it has been
 protected by a fence around it. In 1837 it was eighty feet high by
 measurement and fifty-five feet in the circumference of its branches,
 and does not probably vary much from these dimensions now. Two suckers
 have sprung up on opposite sides of the tree, which bear the same
 fruit as the original, proving it to be ungrafted. It stands near the
 site of the first mansion of the Governor, on a slope where it is
 somewhat sheltered from the north and north-west winds. The soil is a
 light loam, with a substratum of clay. Grafts taken from the old tree
 grow very vigorously. From a pomological point of view, the fruit is
 of no value. It is hardly of medium size, roundish, green, with more
 or less rough russet, very coarse, and soon decays.

 "It may be of interest to state that the farm on which the old tree
 stands is again in the Endicott name, having lately been purchased by
 a descendant of the Governor. The tree stands in the town of Danvers
 originally a part of Salem.

 "For further facts concerning this tree, see the _Transactions of the
 Massachusetts Horticultural Society_ for 1837, and also an article
 by Charles M. Endicott, a descendant of the Governor, in Hovey's
 _Magazine of Horticulture_, vol. xix, p. 254, June, 1853, from which
 the above account has been mainly derived. Each of these articles is
 illustrated with a cut of the pear.

 "The _Orange_ Pear. This tree is owned by Capt. Charles H. Allen,
 and stands in his yard on Hardy street, Salem. The Rev. Dr. Bentley,
 who died about 1820, investigated the history of this tree and found
 it to be then 180 years old, which would make it now 235 years old.
 The trunk is hollow, nine feet five inches in circumference in the
 smallest part near the ground; just below the limbs it is several
 inches more. The tree is more than forty feet high, and the limbs are
 supported by shores. It was grafted in the limbs, as a branch fifteen
 or twenty years old, shooting out several feet higher than a man's
 head, produces 'Button' pears, and a large limb, part of which was
 'Button' which grew out still higher up, was blown off several years
 ago. In the very favorable pear season of 1862 it bore thirteen and a
 half bushels of pears. It bears in alternate years, having produced
 eight and a half bushels in 1873. The brittleness of the limbs of
 old pear trees is well known, yet Capt. Allen, with a care worthy of
 imitation, gathers every pear, excepting about a dozen specimens, by
 hand.

 "This variety was, until the introduction of the modern kinds, highly
 esteemed. It is above medium size, averaging fifty-six pears to the
 peck, globular obtuse pyriform, covered with thin russet, juicy
 when gathered early and ripened in the house; of pleasant flavor
 but rather deficient in this respect. It is ripe about the middle
 of September. It was considered by my father a native, and was
 called by him the _American Orange_, and after examination of the
 descriptions and plates, I cannot think it the same as the _Orange
 Rouge_ or _Orange d'Automne_ of Duhamel, Decaisne, and Leroy. The
 Hon. Paul Dudley, Esq., of Roxbury, in some 'Observations on some of
 the Plants in New England with remarkable Instances of the Power of
 Vegetation,' communicated to the Royal Society of London (I quote from
 the 'Philosophical Transactions,' abridged, London, 1734, Vol. VI,
 Part II, p. 341), says: 'An _Orange_ Pear Tree grows the largest, and
 yields the fairest fruit. I know one of them near forty Foot high,
 that measures six Foot and six Inches in Girt, a Yard from the Ground,
 and has borne thirty Bushels at a Time, and this Year I measured an
 _Orange_ pear, that grew in my own Orchard, of eleven Inches round the
 Bulge.'

 "If this is, as believed, of native origin, it is the oldest American
 fruit in cultivation, unless we except the _Apple_ pear, which is
 probably of about the same date. This is small, oblate, of pale yellow
 color, ripening in August. It is quite distinct from the _Poire Pomme
 d'Hiver_, of Leroy, and I think also from the _Poire Pomme d'Été_, of
 the same author. I had supposed the variety to be extinct, but last
 year discovered in a garden in Salem the remnant of an old tree with
 a trunk four feet in diameter, and still producing fruit.

 "The _Orange_ pear tree which produced the specimens exhibited, was
 inherited by the present owner from his father, to whom it came from
 his wife. It had descended to her almost from the first settlement of
 Salem, but partly in the female line, so that the name of the owner
 sometimes changed. The house on the estate was built in 1812, having
 replaced one which was pulled down after standing 150 years. Within
 the period of a generation there were standing in Salem several trees
 of the _Orange_ pear, some of which were reputed to be more than two
 centuries old, and all of which were undoubtedly very ancient, but
 they are all now gone except Capt. Allen's, the last one having been
 blown down in the winter of 1874-75. I have heard a tradition that
 this last mentioned tree was one of several imported from England and
 planted in gardens at intervals on the northerly side of the principal
 street in Salem. This tradition may or may not be true with regard to
 these trees, but it would not apply to the Allen tree, for the height
 at which it was grafted forbids the idea that it was imported from
 England in a grafted state.

 "The _Anthony Thacher_ Pear. This tree stands near the meadows about a
 fourth of a mile north of the Universalist church in Yarmouth, where
 Anthony Thacher's house formerly stood. It is a large, rotten-hearted
 old tree. It has lost nearly all its old branches, but has thrown out
 many new ones. The late Judge George Thacher, who, if now living,
 would be 120 years old, inquired into its history, and made the matter
 certain that it was planted by Anthony Thacher about 1640. It is
 believed to be a grafted tree, as it contracts two or three inches at
 about a foot and a half from the ground. It is taken good care of and
 will probably last many years. It is now owned by the heirs of James
 C. Hallet. There are other trees of the same kind in the vicinity, but
 their age cannot be proved.

 "The fruit is of medium size, ovate pyriform, green, changing to
 yellow at maturity, of tolerable quality, ripening early in September.
 For the specimens exhibited, as well as the facts above noted, I am
 indebted to the kindness of Amos Otis, Esq., of Yarmouth Port, who had
 made the local history of Cape Cod his study for the last fifty years,
 and who died much lamented on the 19th of October last.

 "Anthony Thacher came from England in 1635, and after residing in
 Marshfield, removed to Yarmouth in 1639, being one of the three
 original grantees of land in that town. The late Dr. James Thacher,
 of Plymouth, author of the 'American Orchardist' (published in 1821),
 was a descendant of Anthony in the sixth generation. Anthony Thacher
 accompanied his cousin, Rev. John Avery, in that disastrous voyage
 of which Whittier has perpetuated the memory in his ballad, 'The
 Swan Song of Parson Avery.' Anthony Thacher got ashore on Thacher's
 Island, the headland of Cape Ann, and gave name to the island.
 (See Whittier's 'Home Ballads' and Young's 'Chronicles of the First
 Planters of Massachusetts,' p. 485.)

 "I endeavored, but without success, to obtain fruit from the pear tree
 planted at least as early as 1650, by Governor Prence, or Prince,
 at Eastham, on Cape Cod, and now owned by Capt. Ezekiel Doane. It
 is known as the _Fall_ pear. It is about the size of a hen's egg,
 tapering towards both ends, green, nearly covered with thin russet,
 of inferior quality, but not as coarse as the _Endicott_. In 1836 it
 was a flourishing, lofty tree, producing an average of fifteen bushels
 of fruit. It consisted of two stems, branching from the ground, the
 larger of which was blown down in the great storm of April, 1851.
 The portion now remaining is thirty-five feet high. It is a natural
 tree and has not failed of bearing for twenty years. It stands in low
 ground.

 "The _Pickering_ or _Warden_ Pear. This tree was grafted on the 19th
 of April, 1775, the day the battle of Lexington was fought, and
 must have been at that time a small tree. It is called by the owner
 the _Uvedale Warden_ or _Pickering_ pear, which are synonyms of the
 _Uvedale's St. Germain_ or _Pound_, but it is entirely distinct from
 that variety, being much smaller as well as otherwise different. It
 resembles, and very probably is identical with, a variety which I have
 known as the _English Warden_, but which I do not find described in
 any pomological work, and have not seen for years. It is of medium
 size, turbinate, light yellow, with a dull brownish cheek, in use in
 winter, for cooking only. Paul Dudley says, in the paper above quoted,
 'I have a _Warden_ Pear Tree that measures five Foot six Inches round.'

 "The Pickering tree contracts suddenly at about a foot from the
 ground, where it must have been grafted. It shows no sign of being
 grafted elsewhere. Below the point of grafting, it is full two feet
 in diameter and is about twenty-five feet high. It stands in a low,
 moist place. The top was much injured by the great gale of September,
 1869, losing several large limbs, but the tree is on the whole in good
 preservation. In the same garden is a tree probably as old or older,
 believed to be a _Messire Jean_.

 "The estate, now much circumscribed from its original extent, on which
 this tree stands, has been in the same family since 1642, having been
 purchased in that year by John Pickering, who came from England in
 1637, and built the house, now standing and occupied by the owner,
 in 1651. It is on Broad street, Salem. The tree was grafted by John
 Pickering, of the fifth generation.

 "The Hon. Timothy Pickering, eminent for his incorruptible integrity
 and immovable firmness, who successively held the offices of
 Adjutant-general and Quartermaster-general in the Revolutionary
 army, and of Postmaster-general, Secretary of War, and Secretary
 of State in the Cabinet of President Washington, and continued to
 hold the last named office under President Adams, was a brother of
 John. At the breaking out of the Revolution he was Colonel of the
 Essex regiment, and on the day when this tree was grafted by John
 Pickering, who was an invalid, his more vigorous brother mustered
 his regiment and marched to intercept the retreating British troops.
 Timothy Pickering was also interested in agriculture, having been
 Secretary of the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture,
 the oldest agricultural society in the United States, and after his
 return to Massachusetts, was the first President of the Essex County
 Agricultural Society. The estate on which the old pear tree stands was
 devised by John Pickering, who died unmarried, to his nephew John, son
 of Timothy, the most eminent American philologist of his time. On his
 death, it descended to his son John, the present owner, to whom I am
 indebted for the facts here stated, as well as for the specimens of
 fruit exhibited at Chicago last September."

Out of an embarrassing number of references in regard to the early
introduction of the pear in New England one may choose the following:
Francis Higginson, writing in 1629, notes that pears are under
cultivation in New England.[6] In the same year, a memorandum of
the Massachusetts Company shows that seeds of pears, with those of
other fruits were sent to the colony.[7] Trees from these seeds grew
amazingly fast in the virgin soils of the colony, for John Josselyn,
who made voyages to New England in 1638 and 1639, writing in his
_New England Rarities Discovered_, notes that "fruit trees prosper
abundantly" enumerating, among others, those of the pear.[8] Josselyn
further says "the Kernels sown or Succors planted produce as fair and
good fruit, without grafting, as the trees from which they were taken,"
and that "the Countrey is replenished with fair and large Orchards."
As early as 1641 a nursery had been started in Massachusetts and no
doubt was selling pear-trees. These probably came from seeds, for trees
were not imported until in the next century. Varieties were few then as
for many years later. In 1726, Paul Dudley, one of the Chief Justices
of Massachusetts, in a paper in the _Philosophical Transactions_,
says, "Our apples are without doubt as good as those of England, and
much fairer to look to, and so are the pears, but we have not got all
the sorts." In another paragraph, Justice Dudley gives the following
account of several varieties of pears in these first orchards in New
England.

He says:[9] "An _Orange_ Pear Tree grows the largest and yields the
fairest Fruit. I know one of them near forty Foot high, that measures
six Foot and six Inches in Girt, a Yard from the Ground, and has borne
thirty Bushels at a Time: and this year I measured an _Orange_ Pear,
that grew in my own Orchard, of eleven Inches round the Bulge. I have a
Warden Pear Tree, that measures five Foot six Inches round. One of my
Neighbors has a _Bergamot_ Pear Tree that was brought from _England_ in
a Box, about the Year 1643, that now measures six Foot about, and has
borne twenty-two Bushels of fine Pears in one Year. About twenty years
since, the Owner took a Cyon, and grafted it upon a common Hedge Pear;
but the Fruit does not prove altogether so good, and the Rind or Skin,
is thicker than that of the Original."

Thus, early in the history of Massachusetts, the pear was largely
planted and became a prominent fruit. These early plantations grew
so well that no doubt they inspired the horticulturists of the first
half of the nineteenth century, of which the names of Dearborn, Hovey,
Kenrick, the two Mannings, and Wilder are notable in the history of
the pear in this country, to undertake the popularization of this
fruit by extensive culture, by breeding new varieties, and by the
introduction of the best pears from Europe. Their work, as we shall see
later, gave pear-growing its first great impetus in America. Until the
middle of the last century, the pear industry in America centered in
Massachusetts; and most of the new varieties which originated in this
country and nearly all of the introductions from abroad came from that
state.

The pear was not neglected in the other New England states as the
horticultural records of all attest, but its history in the several
states is so similar in time and events that the account of its early
culture in Massachusetts suffices for the whole region. It must,
however, be noted that the pear was introduced in Maine at a very early
date, probably by the French. In an orchard on the east bank of the
Sheepscot, below Wiscasset Bay, a venerable pear-tree stood until early
in the nineteenth century of such girt and height that it was supposed
to be more than 200 years old. Of the planting of this orchard there
are no records nor traditions. The most reasonable supposition was that
the trees had been planted there by the French in one of the several
attempts of France to colonize the coast of Maine.[10]

This introduction of the French in the history of the pear in the New
World, brings us to a discussion of the part they took in bringing this
fruit to America. The debt to France for early horticulture in America
rests largely on tradition, but in the case of the pear, there are
such substantial proofs of it in ancient pear-trees of enormous size
found on the sites of old French settlements, that though there are
no written records, and even the people and their habitations have
disappeared, it is certain that the seeds from which these venerable
trees sprang were planted by early French explorers or missionaries.
The first plantings of pears made by the French were in Canada. History
and tradition, substantiated by ancient trees, make certain that this
fruit was planted by the first French settlers in Nova Scotia, Cape
Breton, Prince Edward Island, in favored situations bordering on the
St. Lawrence, and on the islands in this river, notably the Island of
Montreal. Later plantations of fruit were set in the Niagara region and
along the Detroit river. No new varieties seem to have come from these
early plantings in Canada, but they demonstrated that pear-growing was
possible.

The history of the pear in America cannot be written without making
note of the magnificent specimens of this fruit standing until recent
years--a few may still be found--about the old French settlements in
Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois. These are offspring of seeds brought
from France. A century ago the French _habitants_ in Detroit had a
tradition as to the manner in which these pears were introduced. The
legend ran that an emigrant from France brought three pear seeds in his
vest pocket, which, planted on the banks of the Detroit river, became
the parents through suckers and seeds of the gigantic old pear-trees
that have long been such striking landmarks of the towns and farms on
the Detroit river. No doubt these trees are the remains of orchards
in which there were apples, and possibly some plums and cherries, of
which the shorter-lived trees long since disappeared, while the pears,
flourishing in a green old age, are the sole remaining relics of the
old French settlements of this region. The writer herewith puts on
record another account of these truly remarkable pears as he saw them
in 1899.

All of these ancient French pears are of the same type, but the fruits
vary slightly, indicating that the trees were grown from seeds,
although some may have come from sprouts since many of the trees
throw out sprouts abundantly. The pears are of medium size, usually
turbinate, and lemon-yellow is the predominating color. The ripening
season runs from late summer to early winter. The flesh is melting,
juicy, usually mildly sweet, spicy, not high in quality for dessert
but excellent for all culinary purposes. But the most remarkable
characters of these French pears are the great size of the trees and
their vigor, healthfulness, productiveness, and longevity. The trees
have the majestic port of a century-old elm or oak. They attain a
height of eighty feet; a girt of eight or ten feet is not uncommon,
while one monarch measured by the writer fell a few inches short of
eleven feet in circumference three feet from the ground. The leaves are
small but abundant, and are of the luxuriant green color that betokens
great vigor. The trees have attained immunity to blight, but the fruits
are inviting prey to codling-moth when that insect is rife. In these
rich river-bottom lands the trees almost annually load themselves with
fruit, a crop of from forty to fifty bushels on one tree not being
uncommon. No one knows the age of most of these ancient lichen-covered
giants, although one which stood until a few years ago was known to
have been planted within the pickets of the palisaded fortress of
Detroit in 1705.

A generation or two ago, these French pears were very common about
the French settlements of Michigan and Canada in this region but they
have been disappearing fast, until it is doubtful if any of those
set by French _habitants_ can be found now. The pears possessed no
commercial value, and were replaced by named varieties better known
by fruit-growers and nurserymen. It is doubtful if the trees of the
newcomers will ever attain the age, size, vigor, and productiveness of
these oldtimers of the French, characters which make them noteworthy in
the history of the pear in America.

Pear-trees of enormous size survive on other sites of old French
settlements in the United States to show what notable horticulturists
the early missionaries of this people were, who, we are many times told
in the early records, usually surrounded their missions and homes with
trees of the apple, peach, pear, and cherry. Pear-trees very like those
found about the French settlements in Canada and Michigan still grow
in the rich intervale lands of the Wabash and Mississippi in Indiana,
Illinois, and Missouri. Vincennes, Indiana, was settled by the French
in 1702; Kaskaskia and Cahokia, Illinois, about 1685; St. Louis,
Missouri, in 1764. These may be set down as approximate dates in which
horticulture began in these inland regions. When the English conquered
these settlements they found giant pear-trees which persisted well into
the last century, the second generation of which were scattered far
and wide in the river settlements of this region. Tradition says that
a Monsieur Girardin, a native of France, planted a pear orchard from
seeds he brought with him at Cahokia about 1780, from which came the
Prairie du Pont pear, a small, roundish, lemon-colored fruit similar
to the French pears of Detroit, borne on an immense blight-proof
tree. No doubt the variety could still be found in this part of the
Mississippi valley. One wishes that the American-born descendants and
the conquerers of these early settlers from Normandy were as energetic
in forwarding horticulture as the first settlers. After the invasion
of the English and later the Americans, there is little evidence of
progress in horticulture in this region, until the early years of the
nineteenth century.

Another famous pear-tree of the Middle West is worthy of notice as an
evidence of early interest in horticulture. This tree, known as the
Ockletree pear, from the name of its owner, has acquired fame as the
largest pear-tree of which there is record. The tree was a seedling
brought from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1804, and was planted in an
orchard at Vincennes, Indiana. It bore a number of record-breaking
crops, the largest of which was 140 bushels of pears borne in 1837.
In 1855, the trunk measured ten and one-half feet in circumference at
the smallest place below the limbs; the top was estimated to have a
spread of 75 feet. The tree gained its great port and productiveness
from spread of branch rather than height, which was estimated to be
only 65 feet. The variety was unknown, but the fruit was said to be
somewhat inferior in quality. This monarch of its species was struck by
a tornado in 1867 which stripped off its branches and caused the death
of the tree a few years later.

Another living monument marked the beginnings of pear-culture in
America until 1866, when the trunk, little more than a shell, was
broken down by a dray, having furnished shade and shelter in a New
York garden for 220 years. This garden was laid out by the redoubtable
Peter Stuyvesant who took the reins of government in New Amsterdam
in 1647, at which time this pear-tree was planted. The pear was a
Summer Bon Chrétien, said to have been imported from Holland in a tub.
Stuyvesant's garden, kept in a high state of cultivation by forty or
fifty negro slaves, was called the "Bouwery," now the Bowery, and the
pear-tree in it stood at what is now the corner of Third Avenue and
Thirteenth Street. No doubt other pears were imported from Holland at
the same time, and from these and seeds and sprouts, this fruit was
started in the Dutch settlements up and down the Hudson, where the pear
even to this day is a favorite fruit, finding here a more congenial
soil and climate than in any other part of America.

Soon after Governor Stuyvesant planted his bowery of fruits, flowers,
and vegetables, the French laid out orchards in the vicinity of New
York City. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, many
Huguenots fled to America. In 1689, some of these French _emigrés_
settled at New Rochelle, New York, and on Long Island. The trees grown
by the Huguenots were usually grafted, the parent plants having been
brought from France. No doubt, it was from these importations that
White Doyenné, Brown Beurré, St. Germain, Virgouleuse, and many other
old French sorts that seem to have been in America from time immemorial
came.

However, the pear, in common with other fruits, was more largely grown
from seeds in these pioneer days than from buds or grafts. Fruits
were known and grown as species and not as varieties almost wholly in
America until the nineteenth century. The sale of budded or grafted
trees began in New York, so far as records show, with the establishment
of a nursery at Flushing, Long Island, in 1730, by Robert Prince.
This nursery afterwards became the famous Linnaean Botanic Garden.
At what date Prince began to offer grafted pears for sale cannot now
be ascertained, but advertisements appearing in 1767, 1771, and 1790
offer named varieties at these dates. The following is a list of pears
offered by the Princes in 1771:[11]

 Bergamot                   Russelet

Coincident with the establishment of nurseries selling named varieties
of pears another event of prime importance to pear-growers occurred.
Pear-blight became epidemic in the orchards along the Hudson, and while
it must have been noticed before, its ravages at this time brought
it prominently to the attention of pear-growers. The disease seems
to have been first mentioned by William Denning who described it in
the _Transactions of the Society for the Promotion of Agriculture_
for 1794 (pt. 2, p. 219) in an article on the decay of apple-trees.
Denning says that he first saw the malady in orchards on the highlands
of the Hudson in 1780 attacking apples, pears, and quinces. He gives a
good description of the disease, but says it is caused by a borer in
the trunk which he found after much labor. From Denning's discovery
until Burrill a hundred years later, in 1882, discovered a cause of
the disease and suggested a preventive, every treatise on the pear
speculates on the cause and cure of pear-blight, a disease which has
been and is the terror and despair of growers of this fruit.

Philadelphia was another center of pear-growing in the early
settlements of the country. The Quakers, settling in Pennsylvania in
1682, planted all of the hardy fruits; which were soon, as we are
several times told, a great asset to the colony. No results worthy of
note seem to have come from these early plantings until nearly a half
century later when John Bartram[12] founded, in 1728, what became a
famous botanic garden. The Bartram Botanic Garden became almost at
once the clearing house for native and foreign fruits and plants, and
to it came several varieties of pears for distribution throughout the
colonies. Here, the first variety of the pear to originate in America
of which we have definite record, came into existence. This was the
Petre pear raised by Bartram, from seeds sent him from England by Lady
Petre. The seed was planted in 1735 near the stone house which Bartram
built with his own hands. The tree still stands, somewhat stricken with
its two centuries, but withal a noble specimen seemingly capable of
breasting the blows of age for many years to come.

The pear industry of the eastern United States is confined to the
regions in which the history of this fruit has been traced, and most
if not all of the varieties that originated in this country until
the middle of the nineteenth century came from the importations to
these French, Dutch, and English settlements. There is little profit,
therefore, in attempting to trace further the history of pear-culture
on the Atlantic seaboard in colonial times. Pears were grown in the
states south of Pennsylvania, for many references are found in the
colonial records of the southern states, but they bring out no new
facts to illuminate the history of this fruit in America. The Quakers
and Swedes grew pears in the regions watered by the Delaware, and the
English in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina all planted pears
with the other hardy fruits only to find that they so quickly succumbed
to unfavorable climate and the blight as to be unprofitable. The
Bergamy and Warden, in particular, are mentioned as varieties of this
fruit grown in the colonial period of the southern colonies.

Perhaps one, at least, of these lesser centers of pear-growing somewhat
to the south of the pear regions in which there are now commercial
plantations should receive notice. In 1794, William Coxe,[13]
Burlington, New Jersey, began planting experimental orchards. Coxe was
acquainted with the leading pomologists of Europe and his own country,
and collected the best varieties of tree-fruits to be found in the
United States, England, and France. In 1817, he published his _View
of the Cultivation of Fruit Trees, and the Management of Orchards
and Cider, etc._, the first American book on pomology. This pioneer
pomologist described 65 varieties of pears, most of which he had grown
at one time or another on his own place, and names 21 other sorts that
were grown in his and neighboring states. Coxe seems to have been the
first nurseryman to import new varieties from the Old World. To Coxe,
more than to any other one man, the regions adjacent to the Delaware
are indebted for the early development of fruit-growing both for
pleasure and profit, and the whole country is indebted to him for the
introduction of many fine fruits.

A new phase in the history of the pear began soon after the
Revolutionary war. Until this time, and until well into the next
century, tree-fruits were nearly all seedlings. The pears of the
country until as late as 1830 were for most part seedlings, the
fruits varying greatly in size, shape, color, and flavor. According
to the accounts of the times, the product was so hard of flesh and so
astringent in flavor as to be fit only for cooking and perry. Indeed,
the great object in growing apples, pears, and peaches was the making
of cider, perry, and peach-brandy. Good eating pears were few indeed.
But beginning in a small way with Coxe in New Jersey, as noted, a
little later with William Kenrick, Newton, Massachusetts, and still
later with Robert Manning, Salem, Massachusetts, the importation of
European varieties of fruits became an important part of the nursery
business. The importation of pears became an obsession with Manning,
his nursery alone importing several hundred varieties. Manning's work
must have a more extended notice.

In 1823, Robert Manning established a pomological garden at Salem,
Massachusetts, to collect and test as many varieties of fruits as he
could obtain, native and foreign, with the intention of propagating and
distributing those which proved most worthy. In furthering this great
project he entered into correspondence with the leading pomologists
of Europe, and from them secured trees and cions, which, with native
sorts, brought his collection up to 2000 varieties of fruits at the
time of his death in 1842. More than half of the varieties planted by
Manning were pears. This, it will be remembered, was the period in
which Belgian, French, and English pomologists were making pears a
specialty, and led by Van Mons, the Belgian scientist, had succeeded
in putting almost a new pear flora in the hands of fruit-growers.
Manning grew in America nearly all of Van Mons' introductions, received
direct from the originator, and many acquisitions from other European
pomologists as well, notably many varieties from Robert Thompson of
the London Horticultural Society. Manning was one of the most careful
observers amongst American pomologists, and to him pear-growers are
indebted for the first full and accurate descriptions of the fruits
grown in his time in this country. These were published in 1838 in
his _Book of Fruits_. American pomologies before and many since were
compilations. Manning made his descriptions first-hand and described
no fruit "not actually identified beyond a reasonable doubt of its
genuineness."

After Manning, one might well scan the work of several eminent American
pomologists who made pears a specialty. Robert Manning, Jr., continued
the work of his father with this fruit and the two Downings, Wilder,
Barry, and Thomson found the pear the most interesting of the fruits
which they grew. To all of these men, pomologists are indebted for the
introduction of many new and choice pears; for the identification of
varieties; for the correction of the nomenclature of this fruit; for
testing hundreds of seedlings and native and foreign varieties; and for
the distribution of pears throughout the whole country.

A history of the pear in America requires some mention of its
introduction in the Pacific states since that region is now the
greatest center of the pear industry in the country, and the home of
several notable varieties. Franciscan monks established missions in
California at about the time the colonies on the eastern coast were
fighting for their independence. To these they brought the cultivated
plants of Europe and among them the pear. Vancouver, in 1792, found all
of the hardy fruits growing at Santa Clara and the mission of San Buena
Ventura, California. Robinson, a little later, describes extensive
orchards connected with the mission of San Gabriel in which there were
pears in abundance. In 1846, Edwin Bryant found at the mission of San
Jose six hundred pear-trees bearing fruit in great abundance and full
perfection. The missions were secularized in 1834, and the orchards
fell into decay. But the pear and the vine withstood neglect, drouth,
and the browsing of cattle to furnish food to the Argonauts of '49. But
little came of these early plantings that affects the present industry
of growing pears in California either as to methods of culture or the
introduction of new varieties.

As an example of the remarkable recuperative power of the pear,
however, the orchard which Bryant described in 1846 at the San Gabriel
Mission is noteworthy. An enterprising pioneer, W. M. Stockton, grafted
over the old orchard in 1854 to improved varieties, and by pruning,
cultivation, and irrigation succeeded in rejuvenating it so that the
orchard became a profitable commercial plantation--the first commercial
pear orchard in California. There are other instances given in the
early accounts of fruit-growing in California in which the youth of old
pear-trees was renewed by generous treatment, showing that the pear
in a congenial soil and climate is most self-assertive in maintaining
life. It could hardly be otherwise than that the health and vigor of
these old trees stimulated the planting of fruits by the gold-seekers
who rushed to this region in 1849.

Meanwhile, orcharding had been established as an avocation. In the rich
Willamette Valley in Oregon, where the growing of wheat and cattle
was the vocation, the plantations of hardy fruits made by Henderson
Lewelling, near Portland, Oregon, in 1847, included pears and marked
the beginning of pear-culture in Oregon. Lewelling's venture, so
pregnant with results in pomology for the Pacific Northwest, has
been described in _The Cherries of New York_, and needs no detailed
description here. It is mentioned only to call attention to it as
another landmark in the history of the pear.

The padres began the cultivation of the pear at the missions. The
pioneers of '47 in Oregon and '49 in California started a new era in
the cultivation of this and other tree-fruits by introducing named and
improved varieties and extending their cultivation along the coast from
British Columbia to Lower California. So far, the plantings were fruit
gardens, not orchards. The era of commercial fruit-growing began in
the year 1869 in which the first fresh fruits were sent east by rail,
the shipment amounting to thirty-three tons, mostly pears and apples.
This event marks the beginning of a great industry in growing pears on
the Pacific slope for the fresh fruit market, and was followed shortly
by the introduction of canning and evaporation to use up the surplus
product. The special demands of these three more or less distinct
industries called for new varieties, and American pomology has been
enriched by a score or more varieties of pears from this great pear
region.

An event which has had a profound influence on pear-growing in the
whole country was the introduction of Oriental pears and their hybrids.
The mongrel offspring of the Oriental with the European pear were
unfortunate in regions where pure-bred European sorts can be grown, but
in vast tracts of the United States, as almost the whole of the South
and the Middle West, only hybrids of the two species find a congenial
environment, and here varieties with Oriental blood became a great
asset. The introduction of these pears, also, has greatly stimulated
the canning of this fruit in regions where fruit-preserving is an
industry. It was hoped that these hybrids could be used successfully as
stocks upon which European varieties could be worked, but the stocks
have not proved satisfactory, and their use is decreasing.

The Oriental, Chinese, or Sand pear came into America from Asia by
the way of Europe. The importation into Europe was made by the Royal
Horticultural Society of London in 1820. There seems to be no record
of when these pears reached America, but they were growing in the
Prince Nursery as early as 1840 under the names Chinese pear and
Sha Lea. Here, or in one of several nurseries to which it was sent
by Prince, the Oriental seems to have hybridized with the European
pear, the product being the Le Conte, which came to notice in 1846
and is the first of these hybrids on record. The Kieffer fruited
first in 1873 and proved to be much better than Le Conte except in
certain parts of the South. The Garber, another valuable hybrid, came
to notice about 1880. There are now, perhaps, two score of these
hybrids, with new ones coming from time to time. These hybrid pears,
while not blight-proof, are more immune to blight than the European
varieties, and pear-breeders are hybridizing the two species with the
hope of obtaining a variety with the fruit of the European type on
a tree of the Oriental type. Several promising seedlings bred with
this combination in view have been announced, and the number of these
hybrids is certain to be increased as time goes on.

The advent of Russian pears in the United States must also be mentioned
as a notable event in the history of this fruit. Russian pears are
hardy strains of _Pyrus communis_ grown from time immemorial in Russia.
The fruits of these Russian varieties are low in quality, but the
trees are much hardier than those of strains coming from more southern
parts of Europe. Some seventy or eighty of these hardy pears have
been imported from Russia, the first shipment coming in 1879 from
St. Petersburg. For a few years importations followed rapidly, and
fruit-growers in cold regions had high hopes of being able to grow
pears in competition with growers in more favored regions. The fruits
turned out to be so poor in quality and the trees so subject to blight,
however, that the cultivation of all but a few varieties has ceased.
Of the whole number, Bessemianka, possibly, is the only one worthy of
comparison with the pears of southern Europe, and this sort is rated
as poor where the southern pears are grown. Professor J. L. Budd,[14]
Ames, Iowa, and Charles Gibb, Montreal, Canada, were the two men most
instrumental in bringing these pears to America.

The chief import of these brief records of the origin and history of
cultivated pears in several countries is to show the evolution of
this fruit. It is hoped that the chapter will furnish inspiration for
further amelioration of the pear, and that it contains facts that will
be helpful in the future development of this fruit. The men, times,
and places have historical and narrative interest to pomologists; but
these are quite secondary to the knowledge of what the raw material
was from which our pear flora has been fashioned, and the methods of
domestication that were employed. This chapter is only a sketch--the
briefest possible outline of how the leading types of pears came to be,
and how and when they came to America.




                              CHAPTER II

                 SPECIES OF PEARS AND THEIR CHARACTERS


The pear belongs to the great order Rosaceae, the Rose Family. There
are about ninety genera in this family, the most important of all
botanical groups to growers of hardy fruits, of which ten or twelve
bear pome-fruits. Of the genera whose fruits are pomes, only two
contain important hardy fruits, namely, Pyrus, to which belong apples,
crab-apples, and pears; and Cydonia, the quince. Three other genera
are of lesser importance, but must be named to show their relationship
to the pear. These are Mespilus, the medlar, grown in Europe but
little known in America; Chænomeles, the Japanese quince, well known
as an ornamental, the fruits of which are used for conserves; and
Amelanchier, the Juneberry, a common fruit in American forests. One
other genus in this family has possibilities for domestication but
is not yet cultivated for its fruits in America. This is Cratægus,
comprising the hawthorns and thorn-apples, the fruits of which are
edible and several species of which are cultivated in various parts of
the world as food plants.

Nearly every botanist who has attempted to classify plants has grouped
the pome-fruits according to a plan of his own. There are, therefore,
several classifications of genera and species of the pomes, in
consequence of which the nomenclature is badly confused. A century ago
the tendency was for botanists to put in the genus Pyrus the apple,
pear, crab-apple, quince, medlar, sorbus, and chokeberry. The modern
tendency is to segregate these fruits in distinct genera in accordance
with common names. As a rule the differences which suggest a distinct
common name suffice for a botanical division.

The pear and apple, however, are usually kept together in Pyrus, and
botanists generally agree that separation in species is sufficient, or,
at most, that the separation should not be greater than in two sections
of the genus. Happily, the difficulties of classification in botany
trouble little or not at all in pomology, as each of the pome-fruits
constitutes a distinct pomological group. The distinguishing characters
of Pyrus are:

 Woody plants, trees or shrubs, with smooth or scaly bark. Leaves
 simple, or sometimes lobed, alternate, usually serrate, deciduous,
 with deciduous stipules which are free from the petiole. Flowers
 perfect, regular, borne in compound terminal cymes; torus urn-shaped,
 adnate to the ovary and inclosing it with thick, succulent flesh
 at maturity; calyx-lobes 5, acuminate and reflexed, persistent in
 some and deciduous in other species; petals 5, white, pink or red,
 inserted on the thickened border of the disk; stamens 15 to 20, in
 three rows; styles 2 to 5, free or united below; carpels 2 to 5,
 inferior, crowned by the styles, usually 2-seeded. Fruit an ovoid or
 pyriform pome; seeds two in each cell, brown or brownish, lustrous,
 mucilaginous on the outer surface.

The genus comprises fifty to sixty species in the north temperate zone
of the three continents. The largest number is found in south-central
and eastern Asia. In North America, Pyrus is represented by five
species, while eight or nine species inhabit Europe. In several of the
species there are many natural varieties. The two sections of Pyrus,
given the rank of genera by some authors, are distinguished as follows:

 1. Apples (Malus). Flowers pink, rose-color, red or sometimes white,
 borne in fascicles or subumbellate clusters on short spurs or lateral
 branchlets; ovary 3- to 5-celled; styles more or less united at the
 base. Fruit more or less globular with a distinct depression at both
 ends, the flesh without grit cells, rounded at the base. The species
 in this section number 30 to 40, of which not more than a half dozen
 are domesticated.

 2. Pears (Pyrus). Flowers white, few, borne in corymbs on short spurs
 or lateral branchlets; ovary 5-celled; styles usually free. Fruit
 usually pyriform, sometimes subglobose, usually conical at the base,
 the flesh usually bearing grit cells when ripened on the tree. The
 species number 15 to 20 of which but two are truly domesticated, but
 several others give promise of value for stocks and possibly for their
 fruits.


                   THE STRUCTURAL BOTANY OF THE PEAR

A major purpose in _The Pears of New York_ is to describe varieties
of pears so that their faults and merits can be seen, and that
varieties may be identified. It is apparent at once that one cannot
describe accurately nor understand the descriptions of others unless
acquainted with the organs of tree and fruit--one must know the form
and structure of the whole plant. A study of the organs of plants is
structural botany. Plant descriptions are portraitures of the plant's
organs, and structural botany thus becomes the foundation of systematic
pomology, with a study of which, as concerns the pear, we are to be
chiefly concerned in the following pages. We must, therefore, pay some
attention to the structural botany of the pear. A pear is one of the
pome-fruits. What is a pome?

A pome is variously defined by students of structural botany. The
most conspicuous part of the apple, pear, or quince, the best-known
pome-fruits, is the outer, fleshy, edible part. This succulent part is
said by some botanists to be the thickened calyx; others say that it is
the enlarged receptacle. Some botanists believe that a pome consists
of two to five drupe-like fruits, each drupe called a carpel, each of
which contains one or more seeds. These drupes, if they are rightly
so-named, are held together by a fleshy receptacle. The best definition
seems to be that a pome is a fleshy fruit of which the compound ovary
is borne within and connected to the receptacle.


                       CHARACTERS OF PEAR-TREES

Pome-fruits are all woody plants, shrubby or tree-like, of which the
pear is always a tree. The value of the variety and the recognition of
it usually depend on characters of the fruits, but the trees are nearly
as distinct as the fruits, are always helpful in identification, and in
the absence of fruit must be relied upon to identify a variety. Also,
and even more important, the pear-grower must know whether the plant is
manageable in the orchard, for which purpose he must have a description
of the chief characters of the tree.

_Size and habit of tree._--Size of tree is a very reliable character
to determine varieties of pears. The Winter Nelis pear is dwarf as
compared with other pears. Size varies greatly with environment, it
must be remembered in using this character. The terms _large_, _small_,
and _medium_ are commonly used to designate size. Vigor, which may be
defined as internal energy, must not be confused with size. Small trees
may be as vigorous as large ones.

The term _habit of growth_, as used by pomologists, has reference
to the form of the top. In describing the tops of pear-trees a
number of self-explanatory terms are used, such as _pyramidal_,
_upright-spreading_, _drooping_, _tall_, _low_, _dense_, _open-topped_,
and _round-topped_. Many if not most varieties of pears may be told
by the form of the top. One can tell Bartlett or Clapp Favorite at a
glance by their upright branches; as one can, also, Beurré d'Anjou and
Beurré Superfin by their wide-spreading branches; or Winter Nelis pear
by its drooping branches. Depending upon the form of the top, a variety
is easy or difficult to manage in an orchard.

_Constitutional characters._--Hardiness, productiveness, susceptibility
to pests, adaptability to diverse soils and climates are vaguely
supposed to be dependent on the constitution of the tree. Pomologists
very generally refer to these characters as constitutional. They speak
of the constitution as the aggregate of the vital powers of a variety.

Horticulturally, hardiness is ability to withstand cold. Obviously,
hardiness is of utmost importance in characterizing the value of a
variety to the pear-grower, and degree of hardiness is of some use in
identifying pears. Bartlett and Beurré Bose are relatively tender to
cold, Tyson is hardy, and Flemish Beauty is very hardy. Less important,
but still of some importance, is the ability to withstand heat, a
character possessed in varying degrees by varieties of pears.

Productiveness, age of bearing, regularity of bearing, certainty of
bearing, and longevity are constitutional characters that must be noted
in full descriptions. All help to determine the value of a variety,
and all aid more or less in classification. For most part, these are
inherent characters and are influenced but little by environment.

The degree of susceptibility of a variety to fungous diseases and
insect pests is a valuable cultural character, but has little use
in identifying or classifying pears. There are great variations in
varieties of pears to the dreaded pear-blight: Bartlett, Beurré Bose,
Beurré d'Anjou, and Clapp Favorite are among the varieties most
susceptible; Kieffer, Seckel, and Winter Nelis are among those least
susceptible to blight. Kieffer and related hybrids are somewhat immune
to San Jose scale, but are very susceptible to psylla. Flemish Beauty
and White Doyenné are so badly attacked by the scab-fungus that it is
almost impossible to grow them in eastern America.

Some of these constitutional characters are much modified by care and
environment, as all are more or less. Care and local environment often
make it possible to grow varieties in special localities, although
some varieties are inherently adapted to a greater number of diverse
conditions than others. Bartlett, Seckel, and Kieffer have in common as
one of their most valuable characters adaptability to a great diversity
of soils and climates.

_Trunk and branch._--The trunk does not count for much in descriptions
of varieties. The height of the trunk usually depends on the whims of
the pruner. Whether _stout_ or _slender_ is sometimes noteworthy. The
bark may be _smooth_ or _shaggy_. Color of bark is often a valuable
diagnostic character, especially in young trees. Many if not most
varieties of pears can be identified in nursery rows by an expert
nurseryman from the color of the bark. Seckel, Sheldon, and Beurré
d'Anjou have remarkably distinctive color as young trees.

The branches of pear-trees are often reliable guides in identifying
varieties in orchard or nursery, especially when trees are leafless
and fruitless. The twisting, drooping branches of Winter Nelis serve
to identify that variety at any time. The zigzag branches of Beurré
d'Anjou and Bloodgood are typical. The branches of Beurré Superfin
are rough and shaggy. Those of Dorset and Fox are slender. The
branches of several well-known pears are spiny. A glance through the
technical descriptions in Chapter IV shows that branches and branchlets
are variously colored. The branchlets may be _stout_ or _slender_,
_long-jointed_ or _short-jointed_, _pubescent_ or _glabrous_,
_straight_ or _zigzag_. The angle at which branchlets are set is often
characteristic. The epidermis may be smooth or covered with scarf-skin.
Lastly, the size, shape, color, number, and position of the corky cells
or lenticels on young wood is most important in identifying trees after
leaves have fallen.

_Leaf-buds and leaves._--Size, length, and shape of leaf-buds are
helpful in identifying varieties when the trees are dormant. There is
considerable difference in the length of buds of different varieties,
and they may vary in thickness; some are _plump_, others are _slender_.
The shape can usually be described as _acute_, _pointed_, _obtuse_,
or _conical_. If the bud lies close to the twig, it is said to be
_appressed_; if it stands from the twig at a considerable angle, it is
_free_. In some varieties the leaf-scar is conspicuous; in others, it
is inconspicuous.

While leaves vary much in accordance with the condition of the plant
which bears them, yet they offer a number of valuable distinguishing
characters. It is important in making use of leaves to take only
those borne on free-growing twigs, as those growing on luxuriant
water-sprouts on the one hand, or on slow-growing spurs on the other
are seldom typical.

The size of the leaf is a most valuable determinant of varieties of
pears. Length and breadth should be given in figures. The shape should
be depicted in carefully chosen words. The body of the leaf is usually
_ovate_ or _oval_, but these shapes must nearly always be modified by
_broad_ or _narrow_, _long_ or _short_. The apex requires a descriptive
word or two; as, _taper-pointed_, _acute_, or _obtuse_. Thickness and
texture are sometimes noteworthy. The texture is usually described
as _stiff_, _leathery_, or _pliant_. Sometimes the leaves are flat;
sometimes folded upward, and rarely they are folded downward. The color
of both the upper and lower surfaces is often important; and the amount
of pubescence, if present, must always be noted on the two surfaces.
The autumnal tint is a marked characteristic in some varieties. The
margins offer valuable evidence for identification in the character
of the serrations which are usually distinct in a variety. Sometimes
glands and hairs are found on the margins, in which case they are
usually noteworthy. The time of appearance and the fall of leaves are
life events that distinguish some varieties. Leaves are many in some
sorts; few in others. The length, thickness, color of the petiole and
whether it is _smooth_, _pubescent_ or _channeled_ are usually worth
noting. The presence and the size and color of stipules are often
important enough to record. The petioles of pear leaves are larger and
slenderer than those of the apple, and the foliage of a pear-tree has
something of the tremulous habit of the aspen and other poplars. The
leaves have a gloss that distinguishes them at once from those of the
apple-tree. As a rule, the foliage of the pear drops earlier in the
autumn than that of the apple.

When the leaves of pears open in the spring they are folded along the
midrib, and are covered with snow-white wool, but at full maturity no
trace of this woolly covering remains. The amount and texture of this
covering on the leaves of different varieties vary greatly, although it
is doubtful if this character is of much use for taxonomic purposes.

_Flower-buds and flowers._--It is not possible to distinguish
flower-buds from leaf-buds by their external appearance as certainly
as might be wished for the purposes of ascertaining what the crop will
be and that pruning and budding may be done more intelligently. As a
rule, however, the flower-buds are larger, plumper, and have a blunter
point. The flower-buds are much like leaf-buds in color--usually a dark
brown. They may be readily told by their contents when examined under
a microscope. Time of opening is a mark of distinction with varieties
that bloom very early or very late, but the flowers of most varieties
of pears open at approximately the same time.

The flowers of pears give small opportunity to identify varieties
but are useful. The petals in most of the flowers of varieties of
_P. communis_ meet or lap at the widest point, which is a short
distance from the point of attachment. Occasionally a variety has
the petals widely separated. Easter Beurré, Vermont Beauty, and Dana
Hovey are examples of varieties with widely-separated petals. Round
and broadly-oval petals meet or lap, long narrow petals are usually
separated. The size, shape, and color of the petals offer the best
means of identification from flowers. The length, thickness, and amount
and kind of pubescence on the styles may distinguish varieties. The
styles of the Howell pear are abnormally short. The number of flowers
in a cluster, and whether the cluster is dense or loose are important.
The character of the fruit-spurs is nearly always noteworthy. The
calyx-tubes, calyx-lobes, and pedicels differ materially. These
structures in the flower, while offering decisive evidence in
identification, are seldom used by pomologists because character of
plant and fruit may be studied during a much longer time and are of
greater cultural importance. In the blooming season, length, diameter,
and the pubescence of stamens may be noted, but much more important
taxonomically is the position of the stamens on the calyx-tube in the
mature fruit. These organs, or remnants of them, persist in the ripened
fruits, as will be noted in the discussion of characters of the fruit.
Lastly, some varieties may be told during the blooming season by the
distribution of the blossoms on the tree. The flowers of many varieties
are borne on the periphery of the tree, and give the plant an aspect by
which one may recognize the variety at once.

If a variety is not noteworthy in the characters for which the fruit
is grown--those which appeal to the senses of taste and sight--it
has small chance of being cultivated long or widely. Hence, especial
attention is paid to descriptions of the fruit. Some pomologists
describe varieties only from the fruit, saying little or nothing about
the plant.


                       FRUIT-CHARACTERS OF POMES

_Season and use._--Perhaps season is the first, and certainly it is one
of the most important characters to be noted in the ripened fruit. By
season is meant the period in which a variety is in proper condition
for use. Unless otherwise stated, season has reference to the period
during which fruit is in condition in ordinary storage, as it is
understood that cold-storage greatly prolongs the natural season. The
terms _summer_, _fall_, and _winter_, sometimes modified by _early_
or _late_, give the season with sufficient accuracy. Keeping quality
and shipping quality, both dependent on several factors, are usually
mentioned in connection with season.

Rather closely connected with season is use. The uses for which a
variety is particularly suited should always be indicated. Thus, a
market variety is one suitable for the general market; a local market
sort is one which does not stand handling well enough for the general
market but is acceptable in local trade. A variety for dessert or
table is suitable for eating in the uncooked state; cooking or kitchen
varieties are desirable for culinary purposes.

_Size and shape of fruit._--Of external characters of pears, size
is important if several typical specimens can be examined, but is
often misleading because under the stress of environment abnormal
specimens may be produced. Gradations in size are expressed by the
terms _large_, _medium_, and _small_, modified by _very_, _above_, and
_below_. Used in connection with size, _uniform_ signifies that the
fruit of a variety runs fairly even in the same size.

Shape is the most important character in describing the fruit. It may
be used with immature as well as mature specimens. In determining
the shape of the fruit, the pear should be held opposite to the eye
perpendicular to the diameter from stem to calyx; or the fruit may be
cut longitudinally at its widest diameter. The shape of the body of
the pear is usually described first, followed by a description of the
narrow part bearing the stem, if this neck is prominent enough to be
noteworthy. A pear is _pyriform_ when the curve formed by the body and
neck is concave; _turbinate_, or top-shaped, when the body is nearly
round with a short neck. The neck may be _long_ or _short_, _distinct_
or _obscure_, _obtuse_ or _acute_. Sheldon is typically turbinate;
Beurré d'Anjou, Beurré Bose, and Bartlett are all pyriform.

A graphic record should accompany a description of the fruit to show
size and shape. A simple outline drawing serves the purpose.

_The stem._--Varying as little as any other character of the pear, the
stem is much used in identification. It may be _long_ and _slender_,
as in the Beurré Bose; _short_ and _thick_, as in Doyenné du Comice;
_fleshy_, as in Louise Bonne de Jersey; _clubbed_, when enlarged at
the end; and _lipped_ when the flesh forms a protuberance under which
the stem is inserted. The stems of pears are often set _obliquely_ as
in Beurré Clairgeau; or are _crooked_ or _curved_ as in Howell. In a
few varieties the stems are _channeled_. The stems of some pears have
distinguishing colors, those of others are pubescent. In some pears, as
Souvenir d'Espéren, there are bud-like projections on the stem.

The length of the stem in pears is a reliable diagnostic character
only when it is known from what part of the flower-cluster the fruit
was developed. For, as a rule, the nearer the flower to the tip of the
raceme in the pear, the shorter the stem on the fruit.

_Cavity and basin._--The cavity, the depression in which the stem
is set, offers several marks which greatly enhance the value of a
description of any of the pears. The cavity may be _acute_ or _obtuse_;
_shallow_, _medium_, or _deep_; _narrow_, _medium_, or _broad_;
_smooth_ or _russeted_; _furrowed_, _ribbed_, _angular_, or _uniform_;
or it may be _lipped_ as described under stem. The color of the skin
within the cavity is sometimes different from that without, and there
may be radiating lines, rays, or streaks.

The basin, the depression in which the calyx is set, is as important
as the cavity in classifying pears and is described by the same terms.
The furrows in the basin are sometimes indistinct and are then called
_wavy_. The skin around the calyx-lobes may be _wrinkled_, _plaited_,
_folded_, or _corrugated_. Rarely, there are fleshy protuberances about
the calyx-lobes called _mammiform appendages_.

_Calyx-lobes._--The withered calyx-lobes persist in some pears and
not in others. They persist in European pears, but are deciduous in
the edible-fruited Asiatic species. The calyx-lobes may be _open_,
_partly open_, or _closed_ in varieties of the fruits in which they
are persistent. In some varieties the segments are separated at the
base; in others, united. The lobes may lie flat on the fruit or may
stand erect. When upright, if the tips incline inward the lobes are
said to be _connivent_; if inclined outward, they are _reflexed_, or
_divergent_. The lobes may be _broad_ or _narrow_, with tips _acute_ or
_accuminate_.

_Characters of the skin._--The skin of all pears offers several most
valuable features for classification. Of these characters, color is
the most important. Perhaps no character of fruits varies more in
accordance with environment than the color, yet the color itself
and the way in which it is distributed on the fruit, serve to make
this character a fairly safe distinguishing mark for most varieties
of pears. The ground-color of pears is the green or yellow-green of
chlorophyll, usually with an over-color of tints and shades of yellow
or red. The over-color may be laid on in _stripes_, _splashes_, or
_streaks_; as a _blush_; may mottle the surface; or may be a single
color, in which case the fruit is said to be _self-colored_. In nearly
all varieties of colored pears, it is not an uncommon anomaly to find
trees under some conditions bearing green fruits. Usually, in pears,
the color is laid on solidly; very few varieties have striped or
splashed fruits.

The skin may be _thick_ or _thin_, _tough_ or _tender_. In a few
varieties it is relatively free from the flesh, but with most clings
tightly. The surface of the skin is often waxy or oily. This character
must not be confused with _waxen_ which refers to the glossy appearance
of the skin.

Some pears have an unbroken russet surface as Beurré Bose and Sheldon.
Or, the surface may be rough because of minute russet dots or netted
veins. With many sorts, the cavity alone is russeted. Sometimes the
russet of the cavity is spread out in radiating lines.

Nearly all pears have few or many dots on the skin, notes on which
may enhance the value of a description. These may be _obscure_ or
_conspicuous, large_ or _small_, _raised_ or _sunken_. If visible under
the epidermis, they are said to be _submerged_. When star-like, they
are called _stellate_. If surrounded by a halo of lighter color, they
are said to be _areolar_. In some varieties, the dots are elongated.
Very often the dots are russeted. The roughened outer skin, called
_scarf-skin_, gives a distinguishing appearance to a few pears.

_Cutting pears to show the internal structure._--When varieties cannot
be distinguished from external marks, there are several very reliable
characters that can be made use of in the internal anatomy of the
fruits. To study these it is necessary to make a longitudinal and a
transverse section of the pear. To make an accurate examination of
the internal structure, the sectioning must be done with a keen, thin
knife, with a steady hand, and a good eye.

In making the longitudinal section the knife should pass through the
center of the calyx, showing the remnants of styles and stamens;
through the middle of the core cell, showing the outline of the core
cavity; and through the middle of the stem. A true record cannot be
obtained, unless the organs named are divided fairly accurately in
halves. In making the transverse section, the knife should pass through
the widest diameter of the fruit, cutting the core in half. If the core
is not in the center of the fruit, trial cuts to locate it must be made
that it may be halved exactly.

_The stamens, calyx-tube, and styles._--After halving the fruit
longitudinally, the first organs to be studied are the stamens, the
position of which furnishes reliable taxonomic data in apples and is
occasionally worth noting in pears. Passing from the stamens to the
calyx-tube, it will be found that the shape of this structure is of
some use in separating varieties, although it is exceedingly variable
in accordance with the size of the pear, and is materially altered by
abnormalities in the fruit. The base of the styles in some varieties
develop into fleshy tissue which alters the shape of the calyx-tube.
The calyx-tube may be _cone-shaped_, _funnel-shaped_, or _urn-shaped_.
When funnel-shaped, the broad upper part is called the _limb_; the
narrow lower part, the _cylinder_. In some varieties the remnants of
the styles are often more or less fleshy and form a point, called the
_pistil point_, which projects into the calyx-tube.

_The core._--The position of the core in the fruit is often a valuable
means of distinguishing varieties. If close to the stem, the core is
said to be _sessile_; if at the center of the pome, it is _median_;
when distant from the stem, _distant_.

The cell containing seed, called a carpel, is morphologically a
modified leaf, which, by folding together and by union of its edges
forms a closed receptacle. In some varieties, the carpels are _open_;
in others _closed_. If the tip of the carpel is indented, it is said to
be _emarginate_; if long and pointed, _mucronate_. In shape, carpels
may be _round_, _cordate_, _obcordate_, _elliptical_, _oblong_,
_elongated_, _ovate_, or _obovate_. In the cores of most pomes there
is a central cavity called the _core cavity_, sometimes spoken of as
the _axial sac_ which may be either _narrow_, _wide_, or _lacking_.
This is a character of much importance and reliability in pears. When
the carpels extend quite to the axis of the fruit, they are said to
be _axile_ and there is no core cavity; when distant from the axis,
they are _abaxile_ and a core cavity is formed. Sometimes the carpel
is lined on the inner surface with a white substance, when it is
said to be _tufted_. In some pears, there are many fine hairs in the
core-cavity in which case the cavity is said to be _tufted_.

The limits of the core are marked by a line in most
pome-fruits--usually very distinct in apples and quinces--which in most
varieties of pears is indistinct. The area enclosed by this line may be
large or small and may be variously shaped. When the core-line joins
the calyx-tube along the sides, it is said to be _clasping_; when the
two ends of the line meet at the base of the calyx-tube, the expression
_core-lines meeting_ is used. The core-line in pears is nearly always,
if not always, clasping and very often it is a more or less thickened
area of grit-cells.

_Seeds._--Seeds are characteristic in all varieties of pears and might
well be used more generally than is the case in classification. The
number is exceedingly variable in different varieties. The usual number
is two in each cell, but often there are three or more and occasionally
they are missing. Seeds vary greatly in different varieties in size,
shape, and color, and differences in these characters are as constant
as are those of any other organ of the fruit. Number, size, shape, and
color of seeds should be noted with care in every technical description
of a pear. The point of the seed, also, is worth noting; it may be
_acute, acuminate_, or _obtuse_. Like the carpels, the seeds are often
_tufted_. There are several so-called seedless pears, but all of these
occasionally contain some seeds. Very often seedlessness is brought
about by lack of proper pollination. An occasional fruit without seeds
is found in nearly all varieties, but these fruits are usually more or
less abnormal in size or shape.

_Flesh._--Most pears may be identified from the flesh-characters
without a glance at any other part of fruit or plant. Flavor, odor, and
texture of flesh are distinct in almost every variety, and appeal more
strongly to the senses of taste and smell than characters measured by
the eye do to the sight. Unfortunately, flavors, odors, and textures
are difficult to describe.

All characters of the flesh vary greatly in accordance with conditions
of growth, soil and climate having a profound influence on texture,
flavor, and quality. It is important, also, in describing the flesh
to have the fruit at the proper stage of maturity, and as immaturity
verges into maturity and maturity into decay almost imperceptibly, each
condition affecting the flesh, it is not surprising that differences of
opinion may be many in judging the flesh-characters of a fruit.

In cutting a pear the color of the flesh is first noted. It may be
nearly white, as in Flemish Beauty; tinged with yellow, as in Tyson;
greenish-white as in Bartlett; or tinged with red, as in Joséphine de
Malines. Pears with red flesh are occasionally found, but no standard
varieties have flesh of this color. Sanguinole, grown more or less
in Europe, has flesh of a wine-red color. Very often the texture of
pear-flesh is marred by grittiness to which some varieties are much
more subject than others. In most cases, however, the grit-cells are
abnormal, and a discussion of their presence and cause belongs under
the head of diseases in another chapter.

One determines the nature of the texture by cutting the fruit, through
pressure by the fingers, and by eating. The texture may be _coarse_ or
_fine_; _tender_ or _tough_; _crisp_, _breaking_, _melting_, or _almost
buttery_; _dry_ or _juicy_.

_Flavor and quality._--Pears are readily divided into two classes as
to flavor; they are either _sweet_ or _sour_. The qualifying terms
_mildly_ and _very_ are often used with sweet and sour. _Subacid_,
_tart_, and _sprightly_ are sometimes most expressive. _Austere_ refers
to a flavor more or less sour with some astringency. The flavor may
often be put down as _astringent_. All varieties have a more or less
distinct aroma. _Rich_ and _refreshing_ are words often found in the
rather extensive vocabulary necessary to describe the flavor of this
fruit.

Quality is that combination of texture, flavor, and aroma which makes
a fruit pleasant to the palate. Quality is rated by common consent of
pomologists by five grades: _Poor_, _fair_, _good_, _very good_, and
_best_. It should be noted that _good_ in this rating signifies a fruit
of but medium quality.

[Illustration: PEAR]

The characters of pears are graphically shown on the opposite page in
a descriptive form filled out for Bartlett in a description of this
variety for _The Pears of New York_. This is, however, but a skeleton,
and most of the characters must be more fully described than a form
like this permits. Few pomologists in these days have the temerity
to offer a description compiled in whole or in part. Descriptions are
worth while only when made from living specimens before the eyes of the
describer.


                           SPECIES OF PEARS

The foregoing pages discussing the characters of pears were preparation
for a proper understanding of descriptions of pears. A discussion of
the species which constitute or may constitute forms for cultivation
either for their fruit or as stocks upon which to grow edible pears
logically follows.

Edible pears fall into two well-marked groups: Those coming from Europe
and northwestern Asia, occidental pears; and those coming from eastern
and northeastern Asia, oriental pears.


                           OCCIDENTAL PEARS

In this group belong the thousands of varieties under common
cultivation in Europe, the United States, and in temperate regions
settled by Europeans. These pears are distinct from oriental pears in
place of origin, and by fairly well-marked botanical characters. Thus,
the leaves of these occidental pears are crenate-serrate and entire
and never setose-serrate; and the calyx is persistent on the fruits.
For most part, the fruits of the two divisions are quite distinct,
especially in shape, but no constant line of cleavage can be found in
the pears. There are several species of these occidental pears grown
for their fruits or as ornamentals. Only one, however, is of great
importance. This is _P. communis_, to a discussion of which we now come.


                     1. =PYRUS COMMUNIS= Linnaeus.

  =1.= Linnaeus _Sp. Pl._ 479. 1753.
  =2.= Loudon _Arb. et Frut. Brit._ =2=:880. 1838.
  =3.= Schneider _Laubholzk_. =1=:661. 1906.

 Tree vigorous, attaining a height of 50 ft. and a diameter of 2 ft.,
 usually with an upright, oblong, or pyramidal, compact top; bark on
 trunk of mature trees rough, with large persistent scales; branches
 usually stout, thorny, variously colored, overlaid with scarf-skin;
 branchlets glossy, smooth, glabrous, with more or less conspicuous
 lenticels. Leaf-buds prominent, plump, obtuse or pointed, mostly
 free; leaf-scars conspicuous. Leaves 2 to 4 in. long, 1 to 2-1/2 in.
 wide, oval or oblong-ovate, thin, hard or leathery, veiny; upper
 surface dark green, glabrous; lower surface light green, glabrous;
 both surfaces downy as the leaves open; apex acuminate; margins
 crenate-serrate or entire, never setose-serrate; teeth often tipped
 with small glands; petiole 1 to 2 in. long, slender. Flower-buds
 larger and plumper than leaf-buds; borne on fruiting spurs in dense
 or loose clusters of 4 to 10; flowers showy, 1 in. across, white or
 sometimes with tinge of pink; calyx persistent or rarely deciduous;
 styles distinct to the base, sometimes downy; stamens 15 to 20;
 pedicels 1 in. long, slender, sometimes pubescent.

 Fruits exceedingly variable under cultivation; varying from 1 in.
 in length and diameter to 3 in. in diameter and 5 to 6 in. in
 length; variously shaped, as pyriform, turbinate, round-conic, or
 round-oblate; green, yellow, red, or russet, or combinations of these
 colors; flesh white, yellowish, sometimes pink or wine-red, rarely
 salmon-colored; flesh firm, melting, or buttery and when ripening
 on the tree with few or many grit-cells. Seeds 1 to 3 in a cell,
 sometimes abortive or wanting, large, brown, or brownish, often tufted
 at the tips.

_Pyrus communis_, the common pear, as stated in the preceding chapter,
is a native of southern Europe and southwestern Asia as far east as
Kashmir. The species is a frequent escape from cultivation, multiplying
from seed distributed by animals and by human agencies, and is now
to be found naturalized in forests and byways of the temperate zones
wherever pears are cultivated in orchards. The pear is not as hardy
as the apple, and is, therefore, less generally grown. It refuses to
grow in the warmest and coldest parts of the temperate zones, but is
a favorite orchard, dooryard, and roadside plant in all mid-temperate
regions.

The species comes from regions or localities where the climate is mild
and equable, neither very hot nor very cold, and grows in moist, cool,
and rather heavy soils. These predilections cling to cultivated pears
wherever grown, and pure-bred varieties do not thrive under other
conditions. Wild or cultivated, the pear is a deep-rooted plant, a fact
that must be taken into consideration in selecting orchard sites. On
shallow soils pears thrive better on the shallow-rooted quince.

Few cultivated fruits have changed more under domestication than
the common pear. The trees under cultivation are larger and much
more vigorous, and the fruits in the best orchard varieties--the
consummation of the breeder's art--would by no one be considered the
same species if the two were found in the wild. The pears from truly
wild trees in the Old World are small, nearly round, hard, gritty,
sour, and astringent. Fruits from the run-wild trees from the chance
transport of seeds in this country are scarcely more attractive to
either eye or palate. The product of these wild trees can hardly be
called edible fruits. Cultivated varieties seem to have been evolved,
until the advent of Le Conte and Kieffer, only by cultivation and
selection. All plants are improved more rapidly under hybridization
than selection, and now that the hybridization of this pear with other
species is in full swing, we may expect, for the New World at least, a
new pear flora in the immediate future.

The pear supplies man not only an important article of food but also
a refreshing drink. Perry, the expressed juice of pears, is a common
drink in all European countries. It is used somewhat as a fruit-juice,
but chiefly as a fermented beverage. Pear-juice is fermented in open
casks and at the end of fermentation contains from six to twelve per
cent of alcohol. In parts of England and France, special varieties are
grown in considerable numbers for perry-making. The wood of the pear is
hard, heavy, and close grained, for which qualities it is esteemed by
turners and engravers and for fuel. A mature pear-tree is a beautiful
ornamental, and few forest trees are nobler or more picturesque than
an old specimen of this species with its great size and irregular,
pyramidal top. A pear-tree has much merit for shade as well as an
ornamental.

Pears are easy of culture and propagation, subjects to be discussed in
full in the next chapter. A few words as to propagation are in place
here to show the affinities of this species with other species and
genera. The common pear readily inter-grafts with other pears, and its
cions may be made to grow, though with difficulty, on the apple. A
most noteworthy fact with this fruit is that though not easily grafted
on the apple and some other pears, it unites readily with the quince
and the hawthorn, both of which belongs to distinct genera. The common
pear hybridizes freely with the oriental pear, but whether with other
species does not appear. There are no records of the pear hybridizing
with the apple, but there are trustworthy accounts of hybrids with the
quince and with sorbus.

The classical name of the pear was Pirus, changed to Pyrus by
Tournefort, after which it was adopted by Linnaeus, who established
the genus and united with it the Malus and Cydonia of Tournefort.
Fortunately there is no confusion in the botanical nomenclature of
this fruit. Botanists agree, without notable divergence of opinion,
on the generic and specific names of this fruit. There are several
well-marked botanical varieties of _Pyrus communis_ as well as a number
of horticultural forms. The most prominent of these must be noted.


                  =PYRUS COMMUNUS PYRASTER= Linnaeus

      =1.= Linnaeus _Sp. Pl._ 479. 1753.

 This variety, rather common in parts of Europe, is similar to the type
 in foliage but has globose fruits. The leaves differ somewhat in being
 more rounded and in having margins more serrate. The plant is often
 very thorny. Some botanists believe this form to be only an escape
 from cultivation.


                  =PYRUS COMMUNIS SATIVA= De Candolle

      =1.= De Candolle _Prod._ =2=:634. 1825.

 This name is applied to the cultivated pear in its many pomological
 forms. The trees are usually larger than those of the wild pears and
 are without thorns. They differ also in having larger leaves, and
 larger and better-flavored fruits.


                    =PYRUS COMMUNIS CORDATA= Hooker

      =1.= Hooker, J. D. _Stud. Flora_ 131. 1878.
      =2.= _P. cordata_ Desvaux _Obs. Pl. Anjou_ 152. 1818.

 This botanical variety is a spiny shrub or shrub-like tree. The leaves
 are smaller than those of the species, 1 in. in width, suborbicular
 to ovate, subcordate at the base. Flowers smaller. Fruit globose or
 slightly turbinate, very small, 1/2 in. in diameter; calyx persistent.
 The species is a native of western France and is found in Devon and
 Cornwall, England. This species is said to propagate itself freely
 from root-suckers which suggests that it might be tried as a dwarfing
 stock for the common pears.


                    =PYRUS COMMUNIS LONGIPES= Henry

      =1.= Henry _Trees Gt. Brit. & Ire._ =6=:1561. 1912.
      =2.= _P. longipes_ Cosson and Durien _Bull. Soc. Bot. France._
          =2=:310. 1855.

 The tree is small with a few spines. The leaves are about 2 in. long
 and 1 in. wide, ovate, acuminate, subcordate, glabrous, finely and
 crenately serrate, on long slender petioles. This variety differs
 little from var. _cordata_ in its fruit except in the deciduous calyx.
 It is found along the mountain streams of Algeria.


                   =PYRUS COMMUNIS MARIANA= Willkomm

      =1.= _Linnaea_ =25=:25. 1852.
      =2.= _P. bourgaeana_ Decaisne _Jar. Fruit._ i. t. 2. 1871.

 This is a small tree found in the Sierra Morena in Spain. The leaves
 are ovate, 1 in. in length, rounded at the base, on very long, slender
 petioles. The pear is very small with a persistent calyx.


                      2. =PYRUS NIVALIS= Jacquin

      =1.= _Fl. Austr._ =2=: 4, t. =107.= 1774.

 Tree small, stout, without thorns; young shoots thickly covered with
 white wool. Leaves oval or obovate, 2 to 3 in. long, 3/4 to 1-1/4 in.
 wide, crenate at the base, entire, upper and lower surfaces covered
 with white wool when young, nearly glaucous and the upper surface
 shining when mature. Flowers white, 1-1/2 in. across, clustered. Fruit
 roundish, yellowish-green, borne on a stalk as long or longer than the
 fruit, acid or becoming sweetish at full maturity.

This pear is a native of eastern Europe and Asia Minor and is often
found in France as an escape from the orchard. The tree, which
sometimes attains a height of fifty feet, is said to be a handsome
ornamental. The species is sometimes under cultivation in France for
the fruits which make very good perry, and when bletted, as is the
medlar, are suitable for dessert. In Austria and adjoining parts of
Germany, the species is somewhat cultivated for the same purposes as
in France under the name _Schnee birn_ or Snow pear, because not fit
to eat until snow falls. This pear might have value to hybridize with
common pears for the improvement of their fruit.

Botanists are not quite certain of the botanical standing of _P.
nivalis_. By some botanists it is considered a cultivated form of _P.
elæagrifolia_ Pallas. By others it is thought to be a cross of which
_P. communis_ is one parent. _P. salvifolia_ De Candolle is either
closely allied to or identical with this species. _P. kotschyana_
Boissier differs from _P. nivalis_ chiefly in having smaller and harder
fruits. _P. elæagrifolia_ Pallas is distinguished by some botanists
from _P. kotschyana_ only by its spiny branches--not a constant
character.


                    =3.= =PYRUS AURICULARIS= Knoop

      =1.= _Pomol._ =2=:38.   1763.
      =2.= _P. irregularis_ Muenchhausen _Hausvater_ =5=:246. 1770.
      =3.= _P. pollveria_ Linnaeus _Mant._ =2=:244. 1771.
      =4.= _P. bollwyleriana_ De Candolle _Fl. France Suppl._ =5=:530.
          1815.

 A tree 30 to 50 ft. high, forming a round head; branchlets and buds
 downy. Leaves ovate or oval, 3 to 4 in. long, 2 to 2-1/2 in. wide;
 pointed, irregular, and coarsely and sometimes doubly toothed; upper
 surface glossy, dark green, with glands on the midrib, glabrous at
 maturity, downy when young; lower surface permanently covered with
 gray tomentum; stalk 1 to 1-1/2 in. long, woolly. Flowers white,
 nearly 1 in. across, 5 to 20 in tomentose corymbs; sepals covered with
 pure white wool on both surfaces; styles 2 to 5, united and tomentose
 at the base; stamens rosy red. Fruit pyriform, 1 to 1-1/2 in. in
 diameter; stalk 1 to 1-1/2 in. long, reddish yellow; flesh yellow,
 sweet.

This tree is an interesting hybrid between _P. communis_ and the
whitebeam, _P. aria_. It was first noticed at Bollweiler, Alsace, and
was first mentioned by J. Bauhin in 1619. It is propagated by grafts
as few of the seeds are fertile and these do not come true to name. It
bears fruit very sparingly, none being produced in some seasons.

Besides the species that have been named there are several other
occidental pears named by European botanists which may be looked
for in botanic gardens. Some of these might have value for work in
hybridization but it is doubtful. Of these, _P. heterophylla_ Regel and
Schmalhausen (_Act. Hort. Petropol_ =5=:pt. ii, 581. 1878) is a small
thorny tree from the mountain valleys of Turkestan. _P. amygdaliformis_
Villars (_Cat. Meth. Jardin Strasbourg_ 323. 1807) is a spiny
shrub or small tree, bearing small worthless fruits; a native of arid
soils in the regions of olives in southern Europe. _P. salicifolia_
Pallas (_Itin._ =3=:734. 1776) is a small spiny tree from the Crimea,
Caucasas, and Armenia; the fruit has little or no value. _P. syriaca_
Boissier (_Diag. Nov. Pl. Orient_ =10=:1. 1849) is a thorny, shrubby
tree from Syria, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan.

A review of botanical literature shows several other names of doubtful
species of Pyrus which seem more likely to be hybrids or abnormal
escapes from orchards. There are, also, many names which seem to be
synonyms. Material and literature at hand do not enable the author to
make certain of these, even if any sufficiently worthy purpose could be
served in a pomological text.


                            ORIENTAL PEARS

The oriental pears have been brought to America in comparatively
recent years, chiefly as ornamentals and for blight-resistant stocks;
but hybrids of at least one species of this group, _P. serotina_,
with the common pear have given many valuable orchard varieties. The
Chinese and Japanese cultivate several species for their fruits. These
pears constitute a group quite distinct in aspect of tree and fruit,
but no characters not in occidental species are found in all species
of the oriental group. The most constant differences, besides region
of origin, are found in the leaves and the calyx. The leaves in most
species are markedly acuminate and their margins are sharp-serrate
or setose-serrate. The calyx falls from the fruit in the species now
cultivated for food, but does not in two species promising for stocks.

                     =4.= =PYRUS SEROTINA= Rehder

      =1.= Rehder _Proc. Amer. Acad. Arts & Sci._ =50=:213. 1915.

 Tree vigorous, upright, attaining a height of 20 to 50 ft., the
 branches becoming glabrous. Leaves ovate-oblong, sometimes ovate,
 3 to 5 in. long, rounded at the base and rarely subcordate or
 cuneate, long-acuminate, sharply setose-serrate, with partially
 appressed seratures; when young, villous, or lower surface cobwebby,
 but becoming glabrous. Flowers white, borne in 6 to 9 flowered
 umbellate-racemose clusters; glabrous or somewhat tomentose and borne
 on slender pedicels; calyx-lobes triangular-ovate and long-acuminate,
 1/4 to 1/2 in. long, glandulose-denticulate; petals oval,
 short-clawed, 3/4 in. long; stamens about 20; styles 4 or 5, glabrous.
 Fruit subglobose, russet-brown; stalk slender; calyx deciduous.

This oriental pear has been referred to _P. sinensis_ Lindley (not
Poiret) by botanists and horticulturists since its introduction
in Europe nearly one hundred years ago until 1915 when Rehder,
discovering that the true _P. sinensis_ had been lost to cultivation,
proposed the name _P. lindleyi_ for one group and _P. serotina_ for
another group of Chinese pears passing under Lindley's original
species, _P. sinensis_.

This species comes from central and western China, where the fruits are
used for food under the name, with that of other brown-fruited species,
of _tang-li_. American pomologists are interested in the type species
as a possible source of blight-resistant stocks for varieties of the
common pear. Stocks of this species, however, grown on the Pacific
slope have not proved satisfactory because difficult to bud, and very
susceptible to leaf-blight, and because they are not as resistant
to pear-blight as an ideal stock should be. Rehder, an authority on
oriental pears, gives two botanical varieties. His var. _stapfiana_
differs from the type in bearing pyriform fruits; leaves with less
appressed serratures; and petals with attenuate claws. So far as now
appears it is of no greater value to pomology than the type. The other
botanical variety which Rehder describes, var. _culta_, is of great
importance in pomology and must have detailed consideration.


                     =PYRUS SEROTINA CULTA= Rehder

      =5.= _P. sinensis culta_ Makino _Tokyo Bot. Mag._ =22=:69. 1908.

 Tree large, vigorous; top spreading, drooping, open; trunk thick,
 shaggy; branches stout, zigzag, greenish-brown, with a slight covering
 of scarf-skin marked with many conspicuous, elongated lenticels;
 branchlets slender, with long internodes, brownish-red, tinged
 with green and with thin, ash-gray scarf-skin, glabrous, with many
 unusually conspicuous, raised lenticels. Leaf-buds sharply pointed,
 plump, thick at the base, free; leaf-scars prominent. Leaves 4-1/8
 in. long, 2-5/8 in. wide, thick, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin
 tipped with very fine reddish-brown glands, finely serrate; petiole
 thick, 2 in. long, lightly pubescent, greenish-red. Flower-buds
 thick, short, conical, plump, free, arranged singly on very short
 spurs; flowers with a disagreeable odor, bloom in mid-season, 1-1/4
 in. across, averaging 7 buds in a cluster; calyx-lobes long, narrow,
 acuminate, glandular, reflexed, lightly pubescent within and without;
 petals broadly oval, entire, apex rounded; pistils 4 or 5, from a
 common base, longer than the stamens, pubescent at base; stamens 1/4
 in. long, with dull red anthers; pedicels 1-1/2 in. long, slender,
 thinly pubescent, pale green.

 Fruit ripe February-March; 2-1/4 in. long, 2-1/8 in. wide, round,
 slightly pyriform, irregularly ribbed, with unequal sides; stem 1-1/2
 in. long, curved, slender; cavity acute, deep, narrow, furrowed,
 lipped; calyx deciduous; basin shallow, wide, obtuse, gently furrowed
 or wrinkled; skin tough, smooth, waxy; color lemon-yellow, with russet
 lines and nettings and many russet specks; dots numerous, small,
 conspicuous, brownish-russet; flesh yellowish-white, very granular,
 crisp, tough, juicy, with a peculiar aroma unlike that of the common
 pear; poor in quality. Core large, open, axile, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds roundish, of medium
 size, wide, plump, obtuse.

The Sand pear differs from the type in fruit and foliage. The pears are
much larger and are commonly apple-form as shown in the accompanying
plate, but trees bearing pyriform fruits are not unknown. The leaves
are larger and broader. Rehder, who separated this form from its
species, writes, "The Japanese pear cultivated under the name Madame
Von Siebold may be considered as representing the type of this
variety." These pears are known to pomologists under several names; as
Chinese Sand, Sand, Japanese, Hawaii, Sha Lea, Gold Dust, Mikado, and
Diamyo, although it is possible that the last three are hybrids. The
pear illustrated and described in this text as a representative of this
botanical variety came from seed sent from Manchuria.

The pears are attractive in appearance, keep well, and are palatable
in culinary preparations, but are possessed of a gritty flesh and
potato-like flavor which debar them as dessert fruits in all regions
where the common pear can be grown. The several varieties of var.
_culta_ now in America came from Japan where the species must have been
early introduced from China as this is now the most common fruit of the
Japanese with the exception of the persimmon. In China and Japan there
are a number of pomological varieties, which, however, differ from
each other less than varieties of the European pear. The fruits of the
several varieties grown in America are often mistaken for apples, from
which they are distinguished by their deciduous calyxes, rough, dry
skins, long stems, juicy, gritty flesh, and insipid potato-like flavor.
Seedlings of var. _culta_ fail as stocks for European varieties in the
same characters in which the species is unsatisfactory.

This oriental pear hybridizes freely with the common pear, and it
is for this purpose that it is most valuable in America. Several of
these hybrids are important commercial varieties in North America
of which Kieffer, Le Conte, and Garber, in the order named, are the
best known and the most useful. Sterility is a common attribute of
hybrids, but the hybrids between these two species are not more sterile
than varieties of the parents. These hybrids are stronger and more
rapid in growth than the common pear and are more productive and more
resistant to blight. The pears are more pyriform and of much better
flavor than those of the oriental parent. The calyx of hybrid fruits
is sometimes persistent and sometimes deciduous. The hybrids do not
make good stocks and intergraft but poorly with the common pear. Of all
pear-trees, these are handsomest in growth when in perfect health and
make excellent ornamental trees. The strong, clean growth, luxuriant
green foliage, beautifully tinted in the autumn, resembles the oriental
rather than the occidental parent. It is doubtful whether hybrid trees
will attain the great size of those of the common pear, and they seem
to succumb to the ills of old age rather more quickly than those of
the European parent. The hybrid pears seem less well liked by the
pestiferous San Jose scale than the common pear. The first flush of
popularity having passed, hybrid pears have found their proper place
in American pomology. They belong to the South and Middle West where
the common pear is illy adapted to the climate. In the North and on the
Pacific slope, pear-growers are wisely planting varieties the fruits of
which are better in quality.

      =4.= _P. sinensis ussuriensis_ Makino _Tokyo Bot. Mag._ =22=:69.
          1908.

Rehder says of _P. ussuriensis_,[15]

 "This species differs from the allied species chiefly in the short
 stalk of the globose fruit with persistent calyx, in the broad, often
 nearly orbicular, strongly setosely serrate leaves and in the lighter
 yellowish-brown branches; the flower clusters are, owing to the short
 stalks, rather dense and hemispherical, the petals are obovate and
 rather gradually narrowed toward the base; the styles are distinctly
 pilose near the base."

Wilson,[16] describing the vegetation of Korea, says of this species:

 "_Pyrus ussuriensis_ is abundant and this year is laden with fruit.
 On some trees the fruit is wholly green, on others reddish on one
 side; the length of the peduncle varies and the same is true of the
 leaf-structure; the calyx is persistent or deciduous often on fruits
 on the same branch."

The habitat of this species is northern and northeastern China and
eastern Siberia. Manchuria, Korea, Amurland, and Ussurri are named as
regions in which it is most commonly found. A glance at the map shows
that this habitat is in the far north for pears, and it might well be
suspected that this would be one of the hardiest of all pears, and this
proves to be the case. Horticultural varieties are reported by Chinese
explorers, some of which have been introduced by the United States
Department of Agriculture. These no doubt have some value in the most
northern fruit regions of America and if not for their fruits, they may
prove useful in hybridization. But it is as a possible stock resistant
to blight that the species has received most attention in this country.

Reimer, of Oregon, found this species to be very resistant to
fire-blight and at first thought it might prove to be a valuable stock.
Following Reimer's experiments much was said of it as a promising
new stock, and the United States Department of Agriculture gave it a
thorough trial from the results of which they discouraged its use. The
tree proved to be a slow grower; very subject to leaf-blight, therefore
unable to hold its leaves during the growing and budding season,
difficult to use in budding as the tough bark did not "slip" easily,
and but a small number of the buds took. According to Galloway,[17]
however, the Kuan li or Chinese water pear, which he says belongs to
the Ussuriensis group, is one of the most promising pear stocks. Both
for its fruits and as a stock, this species is likely to receive much
attention in the United States for some time to come. The difficulty at
present, as we have found at this Station, is to get seeds or budding
wood true to name of the forms of the species that seem to be most
desirable.


                      6. =PYRUS SERRULATA= Rehder

    =1.= _P. serrulata_ Rehder _Proc. Amer. Acad. Arts & Sci._ =50=:234.
        1915.

Chinese Saw-leafed Pear. This species, according to Rehder, is closely
related to _P. serotina_ but differs from it chiefly in its serrulate,
not setosely serrate, generally broader, leaves, in the smaller flowers
with usually three or four styles, and in the shorter sepals and
smaller fruit.

This pear was first found by E. H. Wilson in 1907 in western Hupeh.
The province of Hupeh is 800 or 900 miles west and south of Shanghai.
The pears in this location grow in thickets at an altitude of 4000 to
5000 feet. Reimer found the species at Ichang, in Hupeh, at elevations
of 3000 to 3700 feet. Its occurrence at these altitudes indicates that
it is a hardy form. Whether the species is likely to be valuable for
its fruits, or for hybridization, does not appear, but Galloway,[17]
reporting on it as tested by the United States Department of
Agriculture, says that it is affected but slightly by leaf-blight,
holds its foliage well in hot summers, and has a long budding season.
These statements indicate that it is worth trying as a stock.

      =4.= Sargent _Gard. & For_. =7=:224. 1894. fig. 39.

 Tree vigorous, upright-spreading, tall, open-topped, hardy; trunk
 stocky, shaggy, and rough; branches thick, dull brownish-red, thickly
 coated with gray scarf-skin, sprinkled with numerous small, raised
 lenticels; branchlets slender, willowy, long, with long internodes,
 dull reddish-brown, with gray scarf-skin, heavily pubescent, with
 small, conspicuous, raised lenticels. Leaf-buds small, short,
 flattened, pointed, free. Leaves 4 in. long, 2-1/8 in. wide, thick,
 stiff; apex taper-pointed; margin sharply and coarsely serrate;
 teeth tipped with small, reddish-brown glands; petiole 1-3/4 in.
 long, slender, pubescent, tinged red. Flower-buds small, short,
 conical, plump, free, arranged singly on long spurs; flowers open
 late, with a rather unpleasant odor, showy, 1-3/16 in. across, white,
 in dense clusters, 13 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1-5/16 in. long,
 slender, pubescent, pale green; calyx-tube pale green mingled with
 white pubescence, dark greenish-yellow within, campanulate, thickly
 pubescent; calyx-lobes greenish within and with white pubescence,
 short, narrow, acuminate, tipped with very small, sharp, reddish-brown
 glands, heavily pubescent within and without, reflexed; petals
 separated at the base but with meeting cheeks, round-oval, entire,
 with short, narrow claws, white at the base; anthers deep pinkish-red;
 filaments short, shorter than the petals; styles 2 to 3; pistils
 glabrous, usually as long as the stamens; stigma very small. Fruit
 russet, heavily dotted, the size of a small grape; calyx deciduous;
 pears hanging until the following spring.

The above description was made from a plant grown from seed obtained
from the Arnold Arboretum in 1900, that institution having obtained
the species from the mountains near Peking in 1882. This pear has been
collected by various explorers in the regions about Peking, especially
to the north and east, and is not uncommon in these parts of China. The
small pears are without value for food, but the trees are promising
stocks. While Reimer reports the species as susceptible to fire-blight
in Oregon, it has not proved particularly so on the grounds of this
Station nor elsewhere in the East. The seedlings are also free from
leaf-blight. The young plants grow vigorously from seed or cuttings;
are capable of being budded throughout a long season; they make a good
union with other pears in China according to Reimer; and the variety is
so common in China that there is little difficulty in getting seed true
to name. The tree is a handsome ornamental.


                   =8.= =PYRUS CALLERYANA= Decaisne

    =1.= _P. calleryana Decaisne Jard. Fruit._ =1=:8. 1872.

Rehder[18] says of this species,

 "_Pyrus calleryana_ is a widely distributed species and seems not
 uncommon on mountains at an altitude of from 1000 to 1500 m. It is
 easily recognizable by its comparatively small crenate leaves, like
 the inflorescence glabrous or nearly glabrous, and by its small
 flowers with two, rarely three styles. When unfolding most specimens
 show a loose and thin tomentum on the under side of the leaves which
 usually soon disappears, but in No. 1662 from Kuling even the fully
 grown leaves are loosely rusty tomentose on the midrib beneath. In
 No. 415a the leaves are longer, generally ovate-oblong, the pedicels
 very long and slender, about 3 to 4 cm. long and the sepals are mostly
 long-acuminate. The fruit of No. 556a is rather large, about 1 to 1.4
 cm. in diameter, but a fruit examined proved to be two-celled."

This species is reported from various places in China with western
Hupeh as the chief habitat. Reimer,[19] of Oregon, reports this as a
most promising stock for the common pear, and Galloway,[20] of the
United States Department of Agriculture, says that "Of all the pears
tested and studied this remarkable species holds out the greatest
promise as a stock." In America it stands the cold as far north as the
Arnold Arboretum, near Boston, and endures summer heat as far south as
Brooksville, Florida. The plant is reported as vigorous under nearly
all conditions. Galloway reports that it can be budded from July 1 to
September 1 at Washington. All kinds of pears take well upon it; the
seeds are easily obtained, easily grown, and run remarkably uniform.

      =4.= _P. simonii_ Hort. Not Carrière.

Rehder, who established this species, says of it: "This species seems
to be most closely related to _P. ussuriensis_ Maximowicz which differs
chiefly in the broader orbicular-ovate or ovate leaves, in the lighter
colored branches, and in the short-stalked subglobose fruit with the
persistent sepals spreading. The shape of the fruit of _P. ovoidea_
is very unusual and quite distinct from any pear I know; the fruit
is exactly ovate, broad and rounded at the base and tapering from
the middle toward the truncate apex, as figured by Schneider (fig.
364 d). This may, however, not be a specific character and the shape
of the fruit may vary in other specimens referable to this species.
The Chinese material which I have seen and which might belong here
is very meagre. The Fokien specimen is in young fruit which suggests
a more pyriform shape, though tapering toward the apex and showing
the same kind of persistent calyx; the serration of the leaves is
more minute and more accumbent. The Yunnan specimen is in flower and
differs somewhat in the more copious tomentum of the leaves and of the
inflorescence and in the shorter, nearly entire calyx-lobes.

 "It is not known when and whence this species was introduced. Possibly
 it was sent in the early sixties from northern China by G. E. Simon,
 or by A. David a little later from the same region or from Mongolia to
 the Museum in Paris and was afterwards distributed by Decaisne."

This species is of importance to pear-growers as a stock. Discussing it
as a stock, Reimer[19] says: "This species ranks second only to _Pyrus
ussuriensis_ in blight resistance. During 1915 we were unable to get
the disease to develop more than four inches even in vigorous growing
shoots of this species. During the very favorable season of 1916
vigorous shoots would blight down as much as fifteen inches. As soon as
it reached the hard wood of the previous season it would stop. All the
inoculations into one and two-year-old trunks have failed to develop
the disease.

 "The trees are vigorous growers, and produce medium sized fruit, which
 is egg-shaped, and has a persistent calyx. This species is a native of
 northern China, and was formerly known as _Pyrus simonii_."


                    =10.= =PYRUS VARIOLOSA= Wallich

      =1.= _Cat. No. 680._ 1828.

Reimer,[21] now a leading authority on blight-resistant stocks, writes
of _P. variolosa_: "This species is one of the most promising types in
our collection. The tree is a beautiful, vigorous, upright grower. It
makes a good union with cultivated varieties, and should prove valuable
as a stock for top-working.

 "This species, while not immune to blight, is very resistant. During
 the summer of 1915 a large number of innoculations were made into
 the tips of young branches, and these usually would blight back for
 a distance of three to five inches. During 1916, a very favorable
 season for pear blight, the disease would extend down young branches
 as much as from twelve to eighteen inches, and in one case as much
 as two feet. Seventy-seven inoculations were made into the trunks
 of two-year-old trees. All but seven of them failed to develop the
 disease. In the successful infections, only small superficial cankers
 were produced. In these cankers a new cambium would readily form, and
 the entire wound would heal over perfectly in a short time.

 "The origin of this species, or type, is still a matter of dispute. It
 has been confused with _Pyrus pashia_ of northern India, from which
 species it is very distinct. _Pyrus variolosa_ produces medium sized,
 pear-shaped fruits, which have a persistent calyx. It is possible that
 this is not a distinct species, but a hybrid. If this should prove to
 be the case, it probably will not come true to type from seeds. This
 matter will be determined by a study of the seedlings of this type.
 If this does not come true to type from seeds, the seedlings may be
 of little value for root stocks. If this should prove to be the case,
 it will, nevertheless, be of value as a stock for top-working, when
 propagated by budding or grafting on some other root system."




                              CHAPTER III

                             PEAR CULTURE


The common pear or some of its hybrids with the oriental pear is grown
for a home supply of fruit, if not for the markets, in every part of
North America where hardy fruits thrive except in the extreme north and
south. But commercial pear-growing on this continent is confined to
a few regions, and in these is profitable only in carefully selected
situations. Perhaps the culture of no other fruit, not even of the
tender peach nor of the capricious grape, is more definitely determined
by environment than is that of the pear. A study of the regions in
America in which pears are successfully grown for the markets furnishes
clews to the proper culture of this fruit in New York, and shows with
what regions this State must compete in growing pears for the markets.
The location of the pear regions in America is readily determined by
figures showing the number of trees and their yield in the various
fruit regions of the country.


          PEAR STATISTICS FOR THE UNITED STATES AND NEW YORK

Six states produced over 65 per cent of the pears grown in the United
States in 1919. The census of 1920 shows that in the preceding year the
total crop of the country was 14,211,346 bushels, of which California
produced 3,952,923 bushels; New York, 1,830,237 bushels; Washington,
1,728,759 bushels; Oregon, 761,063 bushels; Texas, 637,400 bushels; and
Missouri, 430,828 bushels. Trees in all other states yielded 4,870,136
bushels. There were according to this census 14,646,995 bearing trees
and 6,051,845 not of bearing age. The yield of fruit was 60 per cent
greater than in 1909; the number of bearing trees 3 per cent less;
and the number of non-bearing trees 28 per cent less. Compared with
other tree-fruits, according to this census, the pear occupies fourth
place in value of product, the apple, peach (including the nectarine),
and plum (including the prune), in order named, outranking the pear.
Probably the orange, grape, and strawberry yield greater value to the
country than the pear, although the acreage of each of these three
fruits is smaller. Commercial production cannot be segregated from
the total, but without question the increase in plantings is due to
commercial activities; for the development of the canning industry,
refrigerator service, and better transportation have greatly stimulated
trade in this fruit.

In the states in which pear-growing is a commercial industry,
commercial orchards are confined to localities in which climate,
soil, and transportation combine to favor the pear. In New York, for
example, pears are grown for market on a large scale in only ten of the
sixty-one counties. These, with the number of trees in each, according
to the last census are as follows: Niagara, 620,743; Monroe, 384,374;
Orleans, 377,371; Columbia, 308,298; Wayne, 305,239; Ulster, 304,158;
Greene, 208,885; Oswego, 154,576; Ontario, 121,934; Orange, 96,456.

Over 77 per cent of all the pear-trees in the State are in these
counties, and 79 per cent of the pears grown in the State are produced
in these ten counties. The production of pears in New York for the
eleven-year period from 1909 to 1919, inclusive, show the increase and
fluctuation in the production of pears in the State for this period.
The figures for 1909 and 1919 are from the thirteenth and fourteenth
census reports, while those of the intervening years are estimates
from the Bureau of Crop Estimates of the United States Department of
Agriculture. The yields run in bushels for the eleven years as follows:
1,343,000, 1,530,000, 1,886,000, 1,128,000, 2,016,000, 1,298,000,
1,375,000, 1,675,000, 1,708,000, 1,352,000, and 1,830,237.

Bartlett and Kieffer are conspicuous leaders among varieties in
number of trees and in production for the whole country. In the great
commercial pear-growing regions of New York and California, Bartlett
is the favorite variety, but Kieffer is grown largely also, especially
for canners. In the South and in the Mississippi Valley, Kieffer is
the leading variety because it is relatively resistant to blight and
withstands extremes in climate better than other varieties. For many
years after its introduction about 1870, Kieffer was over-praised by
both fruit-growers and nurserymen. Fruit-growers liked it because of
its resistance to blight and great productiveness, and nurserymen
preferred it to other sorts because it is the easiest of all varieties
to grow in the nursery. It is, however, so universally condemned for
its tasteless fruits that it is losing its popularity, and is not now
as largely planted in competition with Bartlett as it once was. Seckel,
Clapp Favorite, Winter Nelis, Beurré d'Anjou, Beurré Bosc, Howell,
Sheldon, Beurré Clairgeau, and Garber for the South, are the standard
varieties following Bartlett and Kieffer in popularity.

Bartlett is far in the lead of commercial varieties in New York. At
present, Kieffer probably holds second place in this State, but its
popularity is fast waning and Seckel is nearly as commonly planted,
if, indeed, it does not now surpass Kieffer in number of trees. Clapp
Favorite, Beurré d'Anjou, Beurré Bosc, Beurré Clairgeau, Duchesse
d'Angoulême, Howell, Lawrence, Sheldon, Vermont Beauty, and Winter
Nelis are all planted more or less in commercial orchards, and are
the favorites for home use. All of these varieties are susceptible to
blight, are a little too tender to cold, and have other faults of tree
and fruit, so that pear-growers in New York anxiously look forward to
better varieties. It is hardly too much to say that pear-growing can
never become a great industry in New York until better varieties take
the place of the unreliable sorts that must be planted now.

To some extent, man-governed agencies determine where pears may be
grown profitably if the planter is growing for the markets. Pears do
not keep long and are easily bruised, and transportation must not
take too great toll; therefore, handling facilities must be suitable,
markets must not be distant, and transportation must be cheap and
efficient. But in the culture of this fruit, natural agencies outrank
those depending on man, two of which determine very largely where pears
are to be grown commercially in both the country and the state. These
two, climate and soil, have been mentioned before, but must now be
discussed somewhat in detail.


                                CLIMATE

The ideal climate for a cultivated plant is one in which the plant
thrives as an escape from cultivation wholly independent of care from
man. The apple, cherry, plum, and peach are often found wild in one or
another part of America, but the pear almost never. The pear does not
naturally become inured to the American climate, and in the orchard
is not well acclimated even in the varieties which have originated in
the country. In particular, as a young tree and until well advanced
toward maturity, the pear shows the bad effects of maladjustment to
climate, but as an old tree it seems to be far less susceptible to the
extremes of climate to which fruit trees are subjected in most parts of
America. Both of the two chief constituents of climate, temperature and
rainfall, are determinants of regions and sites in pear-growing.

Extremes in temperature, more particularly of cold, are the only phases
of temperature that pear-growers need consider in New York. The pear is
not nearly as hardy as the apple, and Bartlett, the foremost variety
in the State, is almost as tender to cold as the peach. The limits of
commercial pear-culture are set in this State by the winter climate.
The pear cannot be grown profitably where the temperature often falls
below -15° F., for while winter-killing of the wood does not always
occur at this temperature it sometimes does, and even occasional
injury to the tree is almost fatal to the profitable growing of fruit.
Fruit-buds of the pear are a little more tender to cold than the wood,
and a season's crop is often ruined when the temperature drops to -10°
F. Pears in the nursery are more tender to cold than trees in the
orchard, and unless the wood is thoroughly mature or protected by a
heavy covering of snow, nursery stock is likely to be injured by any
temperature below zero. The injury of nursery stock is manifested in
the well-known "black heart" of young pear-trees subjected to severe
cold.

Happily, there is some flexibility in the constitutions of varieties
of pears, as with all fruits, and a degree of cold that will kill a
variety under one set of conditions may not under another. While,
therefore, it is not safe for commercial fruit-growers to gamble with
the weather, those who grow pears for their own use may do so with
the expectation of losing trees or crop now and then but of having
them in most seasons. A little can be done to prevent winter injury by
carefully selecting sites protected from prevailing winter winds, and
by planting on warm soils on which the wood matures more thoroughly
than on cold soils. Careful cultural methods, especially the use
of cover-crops, may be helpful. Not much can be done in the way of
coddling pear-trees from cold. They cannot be laid down as is sometimes
done with peach-trees, nor can they be grown low enough, even as
dwarfs, to count on much protection from deep snow.

Happily, also, there are varieties of pears endowed with constitutions
fitted for very different climates. Varieties of pears from central
and northern Russia show remarkable capacity in resisting cold, heat,
dryness, strong winds, and other peculiarities of the climate of the
Great Plains, and some of them can be grown in the coldest agricultural
regions of New York. A few hybrids, as Kieffer, Le Conte, Garber,
Douglas, and others of their kind can be grown in the Gulf States
where the common pear cannot withstand the hot summers. Cincinis, Le
Conte, and Garber thrive as far south as central Florida and southern
Texas. There is considerable variation in the hardiness of the common
pear. Tyson, Flemish Beauty, and Beurré Superfin are much hardier than
Bartlett, Seckel, or Clapp Favorite, and may be chosen to extend the
culture of this fruit to any part of New York in which the Baldwin
apple can be grown. It is most surprising to find occasionally these
hardiest of the common pears growing in some of the coldest parts of
the State, usually as demonstrations not only of superior inherent
hardiness but also of hardiness brought about by conditions which
enable the trees to enter the winter with unimpaired constitutions.

The pear is seldom injured by heat in the summers of New York.
Occasionally fruit and foliage suffer from long-continued heat in the
dry weather of a hot summer. More often the trunks of pear-trees are
injured by a blazing sun in late winter or early spring, especially
when the sun's rays are reflected by ice or snow and strike the tree
intensified. Indeed, sun-scald so produced is one of the common
troubles of the pear in New York. With the pear, as with all other
fruits, there is a sum total of heat units above a certain temperature,
put by most experimenters at about 43° F., the awakening point of
growth, necessary to carry the crop from blossoms to proper maturity.
Of the number of units necessary to mature a crop little is known.
Many varieties do not ripen in New York in a cold season, but come to
perfect maturity in warm seasons. A study of phenology would throw much
light on the failure of pears to ripen properly.

The average date at which the last killing frost occurs in the spring
helps to determine the limits in latitude and altitude at which the
pear can be grown in New York. The pear blossoms early, and while both
in bud and blossom the reproductive organs seem able to stand more cold
than those of the peach and sweet cherry, yet even in the most favored
regions for growing this fruit in New York a crop is occasionally lost
from killing frosts, and there are few years in which frost does not
take toll in some part of the State. Damage from frost must be expected
when the commonly recognized precautions in selecting frost-resistant
sites are not recognized. Little or nothing can be done in New York
to prevent injury from frost once trees have been set. Windbreaks,
whitewashing, smudging, and orchard-heaters are all failures in
frost-fighting in this State.

The pear-grower should know how the blooming time of the varieties
of pears he plants agrees in time with spring frosts. To do this he
must have weather data and must know the approximate date of blooming
of varieties. He ought also to be able to synchronize three of these
phases of climate--spring frosts, fall frosts, and the length of the
summer--with the ripening dates of varieties. Data as to the average
dates of spring and fall frosts can be obtained from the nearest local
weather bureau. The accompanying table gives the blooming and ripening
dates of pears grown at the New York Agricultural Experiment Station.
Blooming and ripening dates vary in different parts of the State, and
to make use of the data from this Station the grower must compare the
latitude, altitude, and local environment of his orchard with those of
the Station. Data for the Station is as follows:

The latitude of the Smith Astronomical Observatory, a quarter of a
mile from the Station orchards, is 42° 52' 46.2"; the altitude of the
orchards is from five hundred to five hundred and twenty-five feet
above the sea level. The soil is a loamy but rather cold clay; the
orchards lie about a mile west of Seneca Lake, a body of water forty
miles in length and from one to three and one-half miles in width and
more than six hundred feet deep. The lake has frozen over but a few
times since the region was settled, over a hundred years ago, and has a
very beneficial influence on the adjacent country in lessening the cold
of winter and the heat of summer and in preventing early blooming.

The blooming period is that of full bloom. The data were taken from
trees grown under normal conditions as to pruning, distance apart, and
as to all other factors which might influence the blooming period.
There is a variation of several days between the time of full bloom of
the different varieties of pears. These differences can be utilized in
selecting sorts to avoid injury from frost. In using blooming-time data
it must be kept constantly in mind that varieties of fruits may not
bloom in the same relative time. In very warm or very cold springs the
usual relations of blooming-time may be upset.

Rainfall, moisture, and cloudiness are most important in growing
pears. England, Belgium, and northern France, regions where the pear
finds the climate most congenial, have much cool, moist, cloudy
weather with much less variation in temperature than is the case in
the United States. The climate of New York and the states bordered by
the Great Lakes where most of the pears of eastern America are grown,
is cooler, moister, and cloudiness is more prevalent than in other
eastern states. The summer climate of the Pacific slope is not moist
but is equable and, in the best pear orchards, moisture is supplied
abundantly by irrigation. From these considerations we may assume that
the pear requires more moisture than most other fruits. The pear in
New York more often suffers from too little than from too much rain.
The exception is when pears are in bloom, at which time the crop is
sometimes lost or badly injured by cold, wet weather. Warm, moist
weather is favorable to both fire-blight and the scab fungus, the two
most dreaded diseases of the pear.

Several other weather problems should be studied before selecting
a region as a site for a pear-orchard. The direction, force, and
frequency of prevailing winds both in winter and summer are important
considerations. Unfavorable winds in winter favor winter-killing; in
blooming time prevent the proper setting of fruit; and at ripening time
make many windfalls. Hail storms are more frequent in some parts of New
York than in others and may be a deterrent in selecting a site. Lastly,
drouths, so fatal to the pear, are more common in some parts of the
State than in others.


                     LOCATIONS AND SOILS FOR PEARS

Pears thrive in a great diversity of soils, provided, almost always,
that there is depth for proper root-run. A few varieties may be grown
in comparatively shallow soils, but most pears are deep-rooted. The
common pear is rather averse to sand, gravels, and light soils in
general, and does best in rather heavy loams, clays, and even in
silts. Many varieties show preferences for the several types of loam
and clay, and the commercial grower must see to it that the varieties
he plants are suited in their particular soil preference. Hybrids
between the common pear and the oriental pear--the Kieffer and its
kin--grow well in much lighter soils than pure-bred sorts of the common
pear, and, as a rule, find sands and gravels more to their liking than
clays and heavy loams. Pears will stand rather more water in the soil
than any other of their orchard associates, but a soil water-soaked
for any great length of time in the growing season is a poor medium
in which to grow pears. If, therefore, a soil is not sufficiently dry
naturally it must be tile-drained.

Pear soils must be fertile. All varieties of this fruit refuse to
produce good crops in soils lacking an abundance of the several
chemical elements of plant nutrition. Even the light soils on which
Kieffer, Garber, and Le Conte seem to do best must be well stored
with plant-food. This means that good pear land is costly. Soils that
grow good pears usually grow good farm crops. Pears planted in a poor
soil do not live but linger. Who has not seen short-wooded, rough,
malformed, dwarfed, starved trees which have come to their wretched
condition because planted on land not fertile enough for this fruit?
The land-skinner who grows grass in his orchard usually comes to grief
quickly. Pears start best in a virgin soil from which the forest has
not been long removed; on the other hand, they are often hard to start
on senile soils even though they have been heavily fertilized. Plenty
of humus seems to stimulate pears. There is a prejudice against soils
too rich, some holding that on overly rich land the growth is soft and
sappy and therefore a good medium for the multiplication of the blight
bacteria. This is mostly prejudice, but certain it is that culture and
fertility should not be so managed that the growth continues late, and
the trees go into the winter soft and tender to cold.

Soils seem to have a profound influence on the flavor and texture of
pears. In uncongenial soils the fruits are often so sour or astringent,
dry or gritty, that the product is poor in quality; whereas the pears
of the same variety in a soil to which it is suited are choicely good.
A few varieties, as Bartlett, Clapp Favorite, and Seckel, grow well and
produce fine fruit in a great diversity of soils, but most sorts do so
much better in one soil than in another that it becomes a matter of
prime importance in pear-growing to discover the particular adaptations
of the varieties to be planted. To discover an ideal soil for a variety
is about the highest desideratum in pear-growing.

Some varieties are made to grow in uncongenial soils by grafting them
on stocks better adapted to the soil. Thus, on certain soils some pears
grafted on quince stocks do better than on pear roots. This is a great
field of future discovery and one in which discoveries are being made
as experimenters try new stocks to secure greater resistance to blight.
In all of this work, pear-growers must know not only how well the stock
resists blight, but also how well the cion takes to the stock and the
stock thrives on various soils.

The pear is easy to suit in matter of site for the orchard so far as
lay of land is concerned. Altitude, exposure, slope, and local climate,
all so important in choosing sites for the more tender peach, plum,
and sweet cherry, need receive little consideration in planting the
pear. A site somewhat higher than the surrounding country gives the two
great advantages of soil drainage and air drainage. Good air drainage
is a prime requisite with pears, as it helps to reduce the danger from
frost, and neither pear-scab nor fire-blight are as virulent as on
trees planted on sites where there is little movement of air. Rolling
land, so often recommended for all fruits, seems not to be essential
for pears, as many splendid orchards of this fruit are on flat lands,
which, however, usually have an elevation above the surrounding country
on one or more boundaries. The influence of large bodies of water, so
favorable to the peach, is not as necessary with the pear, although the
best pear regions in the State are near the Great Lakes, the Finger
Lakes, or along the Hudson. There are no successful pear-orchards in
the State surrounded by higher land. Frosts, freezes, pear-blight, and
fungi would soon play havoc with pear-trees in such a situation.

The shelter of hills, forests, or of apple-orchards, provided they do
not shade the pear-orchard too much, may be a valuable adjunct to a
site. Such shelter, however, is desirable only when so situated as to
protect against unseasonable winds and storms. Tree and fruit suffer
greatly when loaded branches are whipped about by strong winds. The
advantages of artificial windbreaks, whether of evergreen or deciduous
trees, are usually more than offset by disadvantages. The direction in
which land slopes is greatly over-emphasized by horticultural writers
if orchards in New York are considered. The only important aspect of
exposure for pears in this State is that the land slope toward the
water when near a large body of water that the orchard may secure in
full the effects that come from planting trees near the water.

Economic considerations are becoming more and more important in
choosing sites for all fruits in New York. Transportation facilities,
including good roads, markets, labor, and packing and selling
organizations are now more important in the pear regions of the State
than the natural determinants of soil and climate, since these are so
favorable in any of the fruit regions in which pears are largely grown.
Natural advantages are more common than man-made ones, and the pear
may be grown on vast areas of New York lands so far as climate and
soil are concerned, but which are wholly unsuited because the economic
factors are unfavorable. Sites for pear-orchards should be sought
for in localities where there are pears enough grown for a central
packing association; near a shipping center where the haul is short and
over good roads; the freight service should be prompt, regular, and
efficient, with low freight and good refrigerator service; labor should
be abundant and not too expensive; and the markets should be several
and so located that they are not controlled by growers in regions more
advantageously situated.

The pear-grower is becoming more and more concerned with the kind of
stock upon which his trees are grafted. One or more of several objects
is sought in working a pear on roots other than its own. The stock
may be chosen, and most often is, with the single purpose in view of
perpetuating a variety; it may be selected to dwarf or magnify the
size of the cion; very often the stock is better adapted to the soil
than the cion would be on its own roots; the quality of the fruit is
sometimes improved by the stock; lastly, some stocks are much more
resistant to fire-blight than others. It is this last character of
the stock that is now receiving most attention. Stock and cion are
united either by budding or grafting, with budding coming more and more
in use. More than with any other fruit, _double-working_ is used in
propagating pears. For example, the quince stock is often preferred to
a pear stock. But some varieties of pears do not unite well with the
quince, in which case a sort which makes a good union with the quince
is first budded or grafted on the stock, and when this cion has grown
to sufficient size, it is top-worked to the desired variety. According
to the size of the mature plant, pear-trees are designated as _dwarfs_
and _standards_, the difference in size being brought about by the
stock. Dwarf trees are usually grown on quince stocks; standards, on
pear stocks.

Dwarfing pear-trees is an old practice, having been in use in Europe
at least 300 years. During this time the use of quince stocks to
dwarf the pear has been a common practice in France and England. For
a century, dwarfing the pear by growing it on the quince has been
common in America. Dwarfing is recommended to secure several effects.
Dwarf trees are more manageable than standard trees when the orchard
area is small; dwarfing stocks are shallow rooted, and dwarfs, as a
rule, do not need a soil so deep as do standard trees; pears grown
on quince stocks are often larger, handsomer, and better in flavor
and texture than those grown as standards; the trees come in bearing
earlier. Dwarf pears, never very common on this continent, are not
planted as much now as they were some years ago. At one time, orchards
of these dwarfs were a familiar sight in New York. A dwarf orchard
and even a dwarf tree is now seldom seen. The faults that have driven
them out of New York are: The stocks used in dwarfing are not uniform,
consequently the trees vary in vigor, health, habit of growth, and in
time of maturity; nurserymen find that the stocks vary greatly in ease
of propagation either from cuttings or layers; the quince stocks are of
several varieties, difficult and expensive to obtain and, therefore,
the orchard trees are expensive; dwarf trees require much more care in
pruning, training, and cultivation than do standard trees; the cost of
producing pears in a dwarf orchard is greater than in a plantation of
standard trees, and the fruit does not command a much higher price;
dwarf trees are commonly rated as less hardy than standard trees and
are much shorter-lived; left to themselves, or if planted too deep,
the cions take root and the trees are but half dwarf. Some of the
objections to dwarf trees could be done away with by obtaining a
variety of the quince which would dwarf the pear satisfactorily, which
could be grown easily from cuttings or layers, and upon which most
pears could be easily worked. A quince of this description is not in
sight.

There is great difference of opinion among growers as to what varieties
may be successfully grown on quince stocks. Probably all will agree
that the following, few indeed, are the best dwarfs in America: Beurré
d'Anjou, Duchesse d'Angoulême, Howell, Lawrence, Louise Bonne de
Jersey, Elizabeth, and White Doyenné. All other sorts, if to be grown
on dwarfs, grow better when double worked.

Almost all of the pears grown in America, as has been said, are
standard trees. The stocks for these standard pears are nearly all
imported from Europe under the name French stocks, although on the
Pacific slope seedlings of oriental species are being used more and
more. The French stocks are seedlings of vigorous forms of the common
pear, _P. communis_. Efforts to grow stocks of this species in America
usually fail because leaf-blight is so destructive as to make their
culture unprofitable. Leaf-blight can be controlled by spraying, but
other deterrents, as high price of labor and losses from dry summers,
added to the cost of spraying, make American-grown stocks expensive.
Stocks raised in this country are usually seedlings from imported seed.
Seedlings of the Sand pear, _P. serotina_, and its hybrids have been
tried extensively in the South and West to obtain cheap stocks more
resistant to pear-blight than the French stock, but they do not seem to
be much more resistant to blight, and many of the best varieties do not
take on these stocks, so that they are generally considered a failure.

New types of stocks are needed badly. The ideal stock must be vigorous
and hardy; fairly immune to leaf-blight and fire-blight; it must
come from a species which seeds freely, and the seedlings from which
are uniform; this ideal stock must be adapted to all pear-growing
regions in the country; a large percentage of the seedlings must make
first-class stocks; the budding season must be long; congeniality with
all cultivated varieties must be great or very nearly perfect; the
consort of stock and cion must make a long-lived tree.

Quince stocks are obtained from cuttings or mound-layers. Layering
is considered the better method of the two. Stocks from the oriental
hybrids, of the Kieffer and Le Conte type, are often grown from
cuttings in the South. These are made in the spring from mature wood
of the preceding year's growth, and are treated much as are grape
and currant cuttings. Long cuttings, a foot in length if possible,
should be used. These stocks are of little value for varieties of
the common pear, but are better than French stocks for the oriental
hybrids, since these, in the South at least, usually overgrow French
stocks. Own-rooted trees of these oriental hybrids are often grown from
cuttings.

While of doubtful utility, stocks from other genera may be used for the
pear. Some of the thorns are occasionally used as dwarfing stocks. The
mountain ash is sometimes used to adapt pears to light sandy soils.
Occasionally one hears of pears grafted on sorbus. The pear on the
apple is short-lived, but old apple-trees top-worked to pears sometimes
give abundant crops for a few years. Apple roots may be used as a nurse
for pear cions. To be successful, the pear cion should be long, when,
if grafted on short apple-roots and set deeply, the pear sends out
roots and eventually becomes own-rooted.


                     PEAR ORCHARDS AND THEIR CARE

Perhaps no tree-fruit is more exacting in care than the pear. Young
trees, in particular, must be well cared for and more or less coddled
if any factor in environment is adverse. Almost any young orchard of
this fruit becomes moribund if the owner settles down to self-satisfied
complacency. As the trees come into full bearing, the several items
of culture need not be so intensive. A perfect pear-orchard is about
the consummation of good fruit-growing. But a perfect orchard of this
fruit is seldom to be found, for, sooner or later, blight is certain
to take its toll. Because of blight, the culture of no other fruit is
attended with more frequent or keener disappointments. Today a man may
walk in his orchard with adoration, as an artist walks in a beautiful
landscape. Tomorrow, blight may blast the fairest trees. Pear-growing,
thus, becomes a good deal of a gamble, and the boundaries within which
a fruit-grower's ambitions must be confined as to acreage must be more
closely drawn than with other fruits. In most pear regions, the risks
are too great to venture all in the culture of this fruit.

It is an uphill task to grow pears on land not well fitted before
planting. A young pear-tree is about the least self-assertive of any
of the tree-fruits. For the first year or two young pears seem to have
almost no internal push, and are unable to get much of a start out of
any but land in the best of tilth. A bare, stony, starved soil is no
place for a young pear. The ground should be well tilled almost or
quite to the depth the trees are to be planted, otherwise the roots
seek the upper layers of earth where there is least resistance and food
is most available. If the drainage is faulty, subsequent treatment
is well-nigh useless. Sometimes retentive soils in which drainage is
good most of the year but slow at planting time may be brought into
condition by plowing a back-furrow along the line of each row in the
direction of surface drainage to carry away the surface water. Under
no circumstances should a tree be planted in a hole in which water
is liable to stand about the roots. If possible, the land should be
prepared a year in advance by putting in a hoed crop, after which it
should be plowed deeply in the fall and pulverized well in the spring,
and the trees planted as promptly as possible.

Land suitable for growing pears does not need to be fertilized for
young trees. It is not too much to say that land which will not grow
good wheat or corn is hardly fit for pears, although lighter soils
fertilized as the trees come in bearing grow some varieties very well;
but even on these the young trees will start as well without as with
fertilizers. Commercial fertilizers, at least, are not wanted by young
trees. Stable manure, usually priceless in orchard regions, often puts
an atmosphere in an orchard not to be had by any other means, chiefly,
probably, because it helps to put the land in good tilth rather than
because of the plant food supplied.

Present practices in the use of fertilizers for mature pear-trees are
very diverse. Until experiments in fertilizing pears are carefully
carried out, the pear-grower may well follow the practices of
apple-growers, since a considerable number of long-time experiments
have thrown light on the fertilizer requirements of apples in the
several great fruit regions of the country. The pear, however, requires
a richer soil than the apple; but, on the other hand, it is pretty
well agreed that the blight bacterium finds readier entrance and a
better medium in which to grow in the soft wood of a luxuriant growth
than in the more compact wood of slow growths. Whatever fertilizer is
used should be applied early to promote early growth and so permit
thorough ripening of wood well in advance of severe cold. Many growers
maintain that blight is less virulent in orchards laid down to grass.
It is doubtful if this is true and if true the produce is so scant
and the pears so small that an orchard grown in grass is about as
often a liability as an asset. When the pear is set in grass, however,
nitrate of soda applied very early in the season in liberal amounts is
a necessary adjunct to the grass-mulch. In any pear orchard, when the
foliage is off color, small, sparse, or hangs limp, nitrate of soda is
a sovereign rejuvenator.

This discussion may be closed with advice as to how one may know
when his trees need fertilizers. If the trees are vigorous, bearing
well, the fruits of proper size, the foliage a luxuriant green, the
growth plump, the buds turgid, he may well assume that his trees need
no additional plant-food. If the trees are not in the condition of
well-being indicated, one ought to be well assured that drainage,
tillage, and health are as they should be before applying expensive and
uncertain fertilizers. Nothing is more satisfactory than making sure
that one is not putting chemicals in the ground for nothing in the use
of fertilizers. A simple experiment to obtain positive evidence as to
whether a pear-orchard needs fertilizers is easily carried on and gives
assurance where before there was doubt.

The following is an example of such an experiment: (1) Acid phosphate
to give about 50 pounds of phosphoric acid to the acre applied to one
plat; (2) phosphate as above and muriate of potash to give 100 pounds
of potash to the acre on another plat; (3) phosphate and muriate as
above and nitrate of soda and dried blood to give 50 pounds of nitrogen
per acre on a third plat; (4) six tons of stable manure on a fourth
plat; and (5) one plat left unfertilized as a check.

Planting practices vary so greatly from place to place and from time
to time, and each method at the place and time seems so justifiable,
that one can hardly advocate particular methods and can only state what
they are. Thus, pears have been set in accordance with all of several
planting plans, and at distances ranging from sixteen to twenty-five
feet apart. At present, pear-orchards are usually laid out in meridians
and parallels at intervals of eighteen and twenty feet; when the first
distance is used, one hundred and thirty-four trees are planted to
the acre; if the second, one hundred and eight trees. It is patent to
the eye of every passer-by that these distances are more often too
small than too great. Certainly on rich soils and with varieties the
trees of which are spreading, the distance might often better be put
at twenty-two or twenty-four feet. A poorly-colored pear is usually a
poorly-flavored pear; and color and flavor are largely dependent on
sunshine and air which are hardly to be had in closely-planted trees.
Perfect alignment is imperative for convenience in working and pride
of appearance. Dwarf trees in New York should be set at least fifteen
feet apart each way, one hundred and ninety-three trees to the acre,
although it is a common practice to set them closer.

Until recently one of the discouragements in pear-growing was the
failure of fruit to set, even though the trees bore an abundance of
blossoms. The discovery that failure was often due to self-sterility in
a variety, and that it was necessary to set another variety near-by to
furnish pollen to fertilize the self-sterile blossoms has removed much
of the uncertainty in growing pears. We now know that self-sterility
has a most important economic aspect in the planting of pears. Some of
the varieties most profitable when planted to secure cross-pollination,
are so unfruitful as to be quite unprofitable when a tree stands
alone or when the variety is set in a solid block with no other sort
near. Under most conditions Bartlett and Kieffer, the mainstays of
American pear-culture, both need pollen from another variety to insure
a full set of fruit. Under some conditions both may be sufficiently
self-fertile. From these two statements it is seen that self-sterility
is not a constant factor in a variety.

Self-sterility and self-fertility are greatly influenced by the
condition under which a variety is grown. Thus, a variety is often
self-sterile in one locality and not in another. Occasionally Bartlett,
usually nearly or quite self-sterile, and other varieties as well,
set fruit one season and not the next. All pears, the Bartlett in
particular, seem to have a greater degree of self-sterility in eastern
pear regions than on the Pacific slope. In general, the better the
adaptation of a variety to its environment the better it sets fruit
with its own pollen. It is obvious, therefore, that it is not possible
to give lists of self-sterile and self-fertile varieties. Such lists
can be made out only for regions and localities. Some varieties,
however, more often fail to set fruit because of self-sterility
than others. Among standard pears, Bartlett, Beurré d'Anjou, Beurré
Clairgeau, Clapp Favorite, Howell, Kieffer, Lawrence, Sheldon, and
Winter Nelis appear to be most often self-sterile. Beurré Bosc, Flemish
Beauty, and Seckel are usually self-fertile.

A self-sterile variety usually sets fruit when another variety is at
hand to supply pollen. Several considerations determine the selection
of varieties to interplant. Thus, the two varieties must blossom at the
same time if cross-pollination is to be effective. The table on pages
88 to 90 shows the sorts that bloom at the same time, or nearly enough
so to make cross-pollination possible. Under normal conditions, the
blooming time of varieties overlaps sufficiently for cross-pollination
excepting those that bloom very early and very late. If the table is
used for regions much to the north or to the south of this Station,
allowance must be made for a shorter blooming period the farther
north; a longer one the farther south. That varieties of pears have
sexual affinities is another consideration that merits some attention.
That is, one variety will fertilize another sort very well, while
pollen from a third may not be at all acceptable. "Affinities" can be
determined only by hand crossing. Probably the importance of affinities
is over-rated. The distance between varieties set for cross-pollination
must not be too great--not more than two or three rows apart. For
convenience in harvesting, varieties should be selected in relation
to ripening. Only commercial varieties should be interplanted, as
the wastage is too great if comparatively worthless sorts are set to
fertilize a standard commercial variety.

Some disadvantages attend the setting of mixed orchards of pears,
and these must be weighed and overcome as far as possible. There are
many current statements to the effect that all varieties, whether
self-sterile or self-fertile, are more fruitful and produce better
fruit with foreign pollen than with their own. To old pear-growers,
this seems to be putting it rather strong, but the statements come from
accurate experimenters and observers and should have consideration.
Cross-pollination, be it remembered, is not a cure-all for failures to
set fruit. Unseasonable weather, lack of vitality in trees, various
fungi, and no doubt other agencies, may be the cause of unfruitfulness.

As to commercial varieties, the tale is soon told. Only a half-dozen
sorts are generally planted in New York orchards. These, about in
order of importance, are: Bartlett, Kieffer, Seckel, Beurré Bosc,
Beurré d'Anjou, and Winter Nelis. To this short list may be added
the following grown more or less for local markets: Clapp Favorite,
Sheldon, Beurré Clairgeau, Lawrence, Howell, Tyson, and Mount Vernon.
A list for the home orchard should include all of these and many more
to be chosen from the major varieties described in Chapter IV. The pear
flora of the country changes very slowly, and there are now almost no
new sorts on general probation in the country.

Perhaps with no other tree-fruits is it more important to begin with
good trees, as even with the best it is often difficult to get a good
start toward a pear-orchard. Black-heart, caused by winter-killing, is
a sign that must be heeded, and a tree badly blackened in its pith,
especially if the surrounding wood is discolored, should be discarded.
Crown-gall on tap roots affects the tree deleteriously. Trees marked
by hail or insects are often worthless. Other marks that commend or
condemn trees are: A short stocky plant is better than a tall spindling
one. A tree with many branches is better than one with few branches.
The roots should be much branched rather than sparsely branched. A tree
with smooth, bright bark is better than one with rough, dull bark. Both
trunk and branches should be plump and show no signs of shrivelling. A
poor pear-tree in the nursery seldom makes a good tree in the orchard.
There is great variation in varieties as the trees come from the
nursery, a fact to be considered. In New York, two-year-old trees are
best.

A good deal of the success that attends the culture of the pear depends
on properly setting the young trees and the right care of the young
plants. It is superfluous to discuss these operations in detail, but
a statement as to proper setting and care will serve as reminders. In
this State, pear-trees should always be set in the spring. A young
pear-tree should be set in the soil about as deep as it stood in the
nursery; in light soils the roots might well be planted a little
deeper, and in heavy soils not quite so deep. The soil must be packed
firmly about the roots--best done by tramping. Watering is necessary
only when the land is parched with drought. When necessary, water
should be used liberally. Puddling the roots by dipping them in thin
mud before planting serves very well for watering. The surface soil
should always be left loose. Rank manure about the roots of young trees
is plant infanticide. During the tender nonage of the young pear,
cultivation should be intensive; insects and fungi should be kept off;
and plants that refuse to grow well must be marked for discarding.

A catch-crop grown between the rows of pears is a profitable adjunct
to the pear-orchard for the first four or five years. Few indeed are
the pear-orchards in New York that cannot be made to sustain themselves
for the first few years by inter-cropping. The crops should be hoed
crops, such as potatoes, cabbage, beans, tomatoes, and nearly all
crops in demand at the canneries. Along the Hudson, small-fruits are
often planted in young pear-orchards, but in Western New York these
are not looked upon with favor. Grass and grain are deadly in a young
pear-orchard, and no right-minded man would plant them there. This
brings us to cultivation.

Cultivation should be the rule; sod mulch, the exception, in growing
pears in New York. After pear-trees come into bearing they may be made
to produce crops if kept in sod. The grass in sodded orchards should
be kept closely mown to form a mulch about the trees. Commercial
fertilizers as well as mulch are needed in sodded orchards, and of
the several chemical fertilizers nitrogen is most requisite. The man
who grows pears in sod must not expect as much fruit, as the crop is
lessened in both number and size of the pears. On the other hand, the
pears may be better colored, and the trees may be freer from blight.

Tillage is begun in the spring by plowing the land. This operation is
followed by cultivation with smoothing-harrow, weeder, or cultivator.
There are several reliable guides to tell when and how often a
pear-orchard should be cultivated. When the soil becomes dry it should
be tilled. A heavy rain should always be followed by the cultivator
to prevent the formation of a crust on the surface. At this time, he
tills twice who tills quickly. Cultivate when there are clods to be
pulverized. Usually a pear-orchard should be cultivated once in two or
three weeks until time to sow the cover-crop in midsummer. The depth
to till is governed by the season and the nature of the soil. Heavy
soils need deep stirring; light soils, shallow stirring. Till moist
soils deeply; dry soils, lightly. The time to stop tillage depends on
the soil, the climate, and the season. The fruit should be nearly full
sized when tillage is stopped and the cover-crop sown.

The cover-crop seed is covered the last time the cultivator goes over
the orchard. Clover, vetch, cow-horn turnip, rape, oats, rye, and
buckwheat are all used as cover-crops in this State. Combination crops
are not popular because of too great cost of seed. The quantity of
seed sown is the same as when the crops are grown as farm crops. The
crops must be changed from time to time in whatever rotation seems
most suitable for the soil. The weather-map must be watched at sowing
time to make sure of a moist seed-bed. Whatever the crop, it should be
plowed under in the fall or early spring, and under no circumstances
should it stand late in the spring to rob the trees of food and
moisture. In moist, hot seasons, the cover-crop should be sown earlier
than in seasons of slow growth, when, possibly, it acts as a deterrent
to blight, and certainly makes more certain thorough ripening of the
new wood.

The double nature of pruning must be kept in mind whenever a pruning
tool is taken in the pear-orchard. Fruit-trees are pruned to increase
the quantity and quality of the crop--this is pruning proper; and
to give the trees such form that they are easily managed in the
orchard--this is training. Pruning tools are used first when the trees
are set, and they should be used every year thereafter as long as the
tree lives. The pruning at setting time is particularly important with
the pear, since newly set pears are slow and uncertain in starting, and
linger in growth for a year or two after going into the orchard. The
pruning is much the same as with other trees, but must be done with a
little greater care.

The top of the young plant must be pruned to enable the injured
root-system to supply the remaining branches with water. The less the
roots are injured, the less the top need be cut. Some cut back all of
the branches; some remove whole branches and do not head back those
that remain. The latter is the better plan for this reason: The top
buds on branches are largest and develop first, and the newly set tree
will grow best if it develops a large leaf-surface before hot dry
weather sets in. Young trees usually have surplus branches; remove
those not needed, leaving three, four, or rarely five to form the
framework of the tree. A pear so pruned will start growth and acquire
vigor more quickly than if all branches are cut back.

A choice must be made when planting as to whether the tree is to be
low- or high-headed. The habit of growth of varieties differs so
greatly that there can be no rule to determine how high the head of
a tree should be started. One can generalize to this extent: The
heads of varieties with spreading tops should be started higher than
those having an upright or pyramidal top. Without question, the choice
should be for a low-headed pear-tree. The trunks of pear-trees suffer
terribly from blight and sun-scald. The less trunk and the more it is
shaded by branches, the less the tree suffers from these two troubles.
Also, low trees are more easily sprayed and pruned; the crop is more
easily thinned and harvested; crop and tree are less subject to injury
by frost; the top is more quickly formed; and a low-headed tree bears
fruit soonest. By low-headed is meant a distance from the ground to the
first limb of two feet.

Two shapes of tops are open to choice--the open-centered and the
close-centered. In the open-centered, or vase-form top, the tree
consists of a short trunk, surmounted by four or five main branches
ascending obliquely. In the close-centered top, the trunk is continued
above the lower branches and forms the center of the tree. The
close-centered pear-tree produces more fruit and is most easily kept to
its shape. No doubt it is best for most varieties. The open-centered
tree, with its framework of several main branches, has the advantage
when trees are attacked by blight, since if one or two branches are
destroyed by the disease a part of the tree may still be saved. The
head should never be formed by two central leaders forming a crotch, as
the trunk is liable to split and ruin the tree.

For several years after planting, the pear needs to be pruned only
to train the tree to the height of head determined upon and to form
the top. Exceptions are the sorts which produce few branches and thus
form straggling heads. This defect is overcome by cutting back some of
the branches in the spring, an operation which increases the number
of branches. A few other sorts, as Winter Nelis and White Doyenné,
have drooping, twisting, wayward branches which can be trained into
manageable shape only by cutting back or tying the branches in place.
Pear-growers as a rule prune young trees too much. Over-pruning
increases the growth of wood and leaf too greatly, and thus delays the
fruiting of the plant. A good deal might be said about the use and
abuse of heading-in pears--that is, cutting back the terminal growths
from year to year. Dwarf pears must be headed-in severely to keep the
trees down, but standard trees should be headed-in only to make the
tops thicker and broader--a desirable procedure with some varieties.

Old trees often need to be pruned to increase their vigor. Such pruning
is often spoken of as _pruning for wood_. When the tops of pear-trees
have dead and dying wood, when the seasonal growth is short and
slender, when the crops are small and the pears lack size, or when
trees are weakened by disease, a healthy condition may oftentimes be
restored by severely cutting back some branches and wholly removing
others. In such pruning the following rules ought to be observed:

Weak-growing varieties are pruned heavily; strong-growing kinds,
lightly.

Varieties which branch freely need little pruning; those having few and
unbranching limbs should be pruned closely.

In cool, damp climates, trees produce much wood and need little
pruning; in hot dry climates, growth is scant and trees need much
pruning.

Rich, deep soils favor growth; trees in such soils should be pruned
lightly. In light or shallow soils, trees produce few and short shoots;
the pruning of trees on such soils should be severe.

A good deal is said about _pruning for fruit_. It is doubtful,
however, whether unfruitful pear-trees can be made more fruitful by
the pruning recommended for this purpose. When barrenness is caused
by the production of wood and foliage at the expense of fruit-buds,
as possibly sometimes happens, summer-pruning may check the
over-production of growth and cause flower-buds to form. There seems
to be no definite experiments to prove this theory in America, nor do
pear-growers generally practice this kind of pruning which has been
preached so long and so often. To follow the rules in this operation,
summer-pruning should be done when the growth for the season has
nearly ceased. If done earlier, the shoots cut back start again and
the pruning has been useless. If done too late, there is too little
time for the production of fruit-buds. In the unequable climate of
this country it is most difficult to know when to prune in the summer
to meet the requirements of the theory urged so strongly by European
pomologists. A weighty objection to summer-pruning in America is that
the wounds might and probably would become centers of infection for
blight.

There is no attempt to give a full discussion of pruning in this
text. Such details as making the cut, covering the wounds, pruning
paraphernalia, filling cavities and the amount to prune, belong to
texts on pruning. Perhaps two minor details important in growing
pears should be mentioned. Suckers or water-sprouts form so freely
on branches of pears that they often seriously devitalize the tree,
and usually are centers of blight. They should therefore be removed
promptly whenever and wherever found. The time to prune the pear is
important. If the work is done too early in the winter, injury may
result to the tissues near the wound from cold or from checking. If
done late in the spring when sap is flowing, the wound becomes wet and
sticky and is a suitable place for the growth of fungi and the blight
bacterium.

The pear is as easily grafted as any other pome, and the operation
is more certain and more often desirable than with any of the
stone-fruits. Almost any method of grafting used with orchard fruits
is successful with the pear. But the pear is not often grafted in this
State after the tree has been set in the orchard. The great objection
is that the vigorous growth made by grafts is nearly always nipped by
blight. Possibly the lack of affinity between different varieties is
more pronounced than with other pomes. The common European varieties
cannot be inter-worked without experimental knowledge of how one
variety will grow on another, and it is almost impossible to intergraft
common varieties with the oriental hybrids. The temptation is strong in
this State to graft such sorts as Bartlett and Seckel on Kieffer. This
combination is seldom successful; nor, as a rule, can other European
pears be grafted on Kieffer, although some growers have succeeded
fairly well in growing Seckel on Kieffer.

Thinning the fruit is not a common practice in pear-growing in this
State. There is no doubt but that much might be done to improve pears
in both size and quality by thinning, for be it remembered that large
size of fruit and high quality are usually correlated in pears.
Thinning often saves the vigor of the tree, and it is often good
orchard management to destroy insect- or disease-infected fruit by
thinning. The objection is high cost. Most growers, however, find that
it pays to thin. Thinning is usually done as soon as possible after
the June drop. It is most difficult to tell, when thinning, what will
prove superfluity at harvest. A skilled grower adjusts the size of the
crop to the variety, the vigor of the tree, fertility and moisture in
the ground, the season, and insects and fungi. Thinning should begin in
the winter with the removal of what seem to be superfluous branches,
for even at this time fruit-prospects for the ensuing season are
fore-shadowed.


                       HARVESTING AND MARKETING

Fruit-growing is made up of several quite distinct phases of activity;
as, propagation, culture, pruning, pests, harvesting, and marketing.
Treated in detail, each of these several operations constitutes matters
quite sufficient for separate treatises. In a manual such as this only
outlines of present practices are in place. Perhaps of all deciduous
fruits the pear needs as particular attention in the various operations
which conduct it from the orchard to the table as any other, if,
indeed, it is not the most difficult of hardy fruits to handle after it
leaves the orchard. The several operations that should be treated in a
discussion of handling the pear crop, no matter how brief, are picking,
grading, packing, storing, shipping, and marketing.

The time of picking is most important in handling pears. Pears are
picked, especially for the markets, long before they are ready to eat
out of hand. So harvested, almost without exception, all pears acquire
higher quality than when they ripen on the tree. Moreover, when the
necessary percentage of sugars and solids has developed to give full
flavor the pears are too easily bruised to be shipped. Just how green
pears can be harvested and afterward have the rich shades of red and
yellow and the delectable flavor of ripe pears develop seems not yet
to have been determined.[22] No doubt the stages of development differ
somewhat with the variety. In New York, the generally accepted rule is
to pick when the stem parts readily from the branch if the fruit is
lifted. Some wait until there is a perceptible yellowing of the maturer
fruits; others until full-grown, wormy specimens are ripe; still others
until the seeds begin to change color. But on the Pacific slope and for
the cannery in this State, pears are picked when much greener than in
any of the conditions named and yet seem to ripen well. As a matter of
economy, the fruits should be left until they attain nearly or quite
full size.

The directions just given apply more particularly to the main-crop
pears and early and fall sorts. Winter pears in this State should be
left on the trees until in danger from freezing. Even so, the season
is too short for some choice winter sorts. No matter what the season,
pears should be shipped before they reach edible condition. A few of
the winter pears, suitable only for culinary purposes, never soften,
and change color little or not at all.

Picking pears is not the delicate business that picking the
stone-fruits is, but yet must be done with considerable care as a
bruise provides a place for subsequent decay. Few picking appliances
are needed, but these should be carefully chosen to insure speed
and careful handling of the fruit. A full complement of ladders is
necessary, and the picking receptacle, either bag, basket, or bucket,
should be chosen to fulfill most conveniently its purpose and yet not
be a source of danger to the fruit. From the picking receptacle, the
pears go to the crate or barrel for carriage to the packing-house; for,
unless the fruit is going to the cannery, pears should be graded and
packed in the packing-house.

Grading pears is a more difficult operation than grading apples, as
mechanical graders have proved of little use, and the work must be
done by hand. Only good fruit is worth grading. It follows, that the
higher the price and the more special the market, the more carefully
should the pears be picked and graded. Pears are usually graded in New
York into firsts, seconds, and culls. The State has no law governing
the grading and packing of pears as it has of apples and peaches, so
that pear-growers must establish their own grades. By common consent
of growers and dealers, Grade I consists of pears of one variety, full
sized, well formed, free from dirt, skin-breaks, worms, scale, scab or
other damage caused by insect or disease, hail pecks, or mechanical
injuries. Grade II differs from Grade I only in that the pears may not
be of full size nor perfect in form. A leeway of five to ten per cent
is allowed for variation incident to grading and handling. Culls are
pears which do not meet the requirements of the foregoing grades.

In putting up grades every effort is made to keep the fruit in a
package uniform in size. At the beginning of the season the sizes are
gauged by putting the pears through rings of the diameter desired.
But packers soon become expert in sizing, and with a little practice
perform the work quickly and accurately without rings. Of the larger
pears, such as Bartlett, Clapp Favorite, Beurré Bosc, and Beurré
d'Anjou, fruits are hardly worth putting in a good package that do not
measure two and one-fourth inches through the shorter axis.

Grading and sizing pears are greatly neglected, and most of the crop
goes to the market in this State wretchedly packed, for which reason
maximum prices are seldom received. The industry can never compete
successfully with western pear-growing until higher standards are
adopted in putting the New York crop on the market.

In common with grading and sizing, packages are neglected in marketing
New York pears. Some growers pack in bushel baskets; a few send the
crop to market in half-bushel baskets; a large size of the Climax
basket is occasionally seen in the markets filled with summer pears or
small Seckels; a keg holding about a bushel or more is less used; a
pear barrel holding a peck less than an apple barrel was formerly more
used than now; Kieffer is often sent to the market in apple barrels. A
very few New York growers ship in boxes, but these are few indeed. In
all excepting the boxes, the pears, having been graded, are carefully
put in the packages, sometimes in layers and sometimes hit or miss,
but the package is always faced. Good grades are usually labeled,
though the same attention is not given to labeling pears that is given
in putting up apples. Truth is, the packing of pears in New York is a
decade or two behind the packing of apples.

The commercial pear-grower now stores his pears in cold storage if he
keeps them any length of time after harvesting. A few varieties, of
which Beurré Bosc is most notable, do not keep well in cold storage,
but most of the mainstays in the pear industry keep fairly well in
artificial cold. There is, however, much to be learned about the
commercial storage of pears. There seems to be little information
that can be relied upon as to how low the temperature should go; how
humid the atmosphere should be; how long the pears can be kept in good
condition; and how different varieties behave under these several
conditions.

Perhaps a word should be said as to how the pear can be ripened best
in the home. After harvesting, the pears should be placed in a cool
sweet-smelling fruit-room in shallow boxes or spread upon shelves to
acquire in time full flavor and color. Most pears part with their
moisture readily, and the pear-room must not be open to draughts which
usually cause the fruits to become hard and leathery or to shrivel.
If the pears are to be kept long, wrapping in paper helps to prevent
shriveling. Nearly all pears ripen perfectly in cool or cold storage,
but a few late winter sorts ripen better if brought into a temperature
of 60° or 70° for two or three weeks before their season.

A large part of New York's pear crop is canned in commercial canneries.
Canners usually pay high prices, and the crop, when sold to them, need
not be so carefully picked, packed, and otherwise handled. It is a
mistake to assume that pears for the cannery can be shaken from the
tree or handled roughly otherwise. Neither do the canners want the poor
grades, after the good pears have been sent to the market. Large sizes
are usually preferred, and the fruits must be well formed, free from
serious insect, fungous, or mechanical injuries, and at a particular
stage of maturity which the canner specifies. The profits in selling to
canners are usually more certain, and are often quite as great as in
selling on the markets. The cannery is a splendid safety valve to the
pear industry in this State. Pears are not dried commercially in New
York as they are in California, although it would seem that here in the
center of the apple-drying industry of the world pears might also be
dried with profit.

Most of the pear crop of this region is now sold to local buyers or on
consignment to city dealers. Co-operative methods are just beginning
and promise much. There are several reasons why the pear, even more
than the apple, which is more and more going to the markets through
co-operative associations, should be handled by organizations of
growers. Thus, an association could load a car quickly, which few
individual growers can do; pears are not now, but would be, graded and
packed under one standard; more favorable transportation rates would be
secured; and, most important of all, the pear crop would be distributed
to the great markets of the country without the disastrous competition
that attends individual marketing. If the pear industry is to grow in
the State, pears must be largely marketed through the central packing
associations that are now being rapidly organized to sell fruits.

No reliable data can be obtained to show what the costs are in
growing pears in this State. It would be hard to obtain such data,
for pear-growing is now a game of chance from start to finish. Good
pear-lands are not hard to obtain, and the risks to tree and crop
attendant on weather are not great, but the trees are everywhere
subject to blight; which, despite the recommendations of plant
pathologists, cannot be controlled, and which annually destroys
thousands of trees, ruins others, and sooner or later upsets
calculations of costs and profits in almost every pear-orchard in the
State. Other pests, as psylla, the scab-fungus, and codling-moth beset
the pear and make profits uncertain. When all goes well, the costs are
about the same as in growing apples, while the profits are somewhat
greater.[23] But with blight to contend with, most of the economic
factors are inconstant, and calculating costs and profits is guessing
pure and simple.


                         DISEASES OF THE PEAR

The pear is attacked by a half dozen or more diseases in New York, of
which two, at least, need treatment every year, in every orchard, and
on nearly every variety. One, pear-blight, is about the most malignant
of the diseases of the orchard, for which there is no antidote and
no alleviation or preventive except by the most drastic sanitary
measures. The other, pear-scab, is always present but not always
destructive, although some varieties are always injured by it. The
scab, however, is amenable to treatment and at its worst only destroys
fruit and foliage, seldom endangering the life of the tree. The four or
five other diseases of the pear in New York are of minor importance and
are readily controlled by the treatment necessary to keep in check the
scab-fungus. Pear-blight merits attention first.

Pear-blight is a malignant bacterial disease, very contagious, usually
virulent and so terrible in its consequences as to warrant the common
name _fire-blight_. No part of the tree is exempt from destruction
by the malign bacterium that causes blight of the pear. Root, trunk,
branch, leaf, flower, and fruit are all attacked, turn black and wither
under the disease. Few plant diseases produce more disastrous results.
The pear competes with the apple in importance in Europe where blight
is unknown. In America it is a poor fourth to the apple, peach, and
plum, and takes fourth place instead of second because of the ravages
of blight. About the most important discovery to be made in pomology is
a race of blight-resistant pears. Failing in this, if the pear-industry
is to grow, or even continue in its present magnitude, blight-resistant
stocks must be found.

The symptoms of pear-blight are so characteristic that the disease
cannot be confounded with any other malady or condition of the
tree. It appears earliest in the season on the blossoms causing
blossom-blight. Attacked by blight, the blossoms wilt, and after the
petals fall, fruit and spur show the characteristic blackening of the
disease. Blossom-blight may escape the attention of the pear-grower,
but twig-blight, a succeeding form of the disease, can escape no
one who has the sense of sight. No other disease of the pear brings
on such palpable destruction to the tree as twig-blight. No other
disease causes such comfortless despair to the grower. Twig, branch,
or tree, as the case may be, in all affected parts, turns black, the
leaves droop, seeming to show the effects of fire. A marked symptom
is, if there can be doubt of those given, that the blackened foliage
clings most tenaciously to the dead branches. Twig-blight is the
most common manifestation of the disease. Another form of the blight
appears as a canker on the trunk and large branches--canker-blight or
body-blight. These cankers are dark, smooth, and sunken, with definite
margins marked by a crevasse in the winter; but as spring comes on
the advancing margins become raised and more or less indefinite.
Occasionally an opaque liquid oozes from lenticels newly attacked. On
branches, the cankers usually surround a smaller offshoot, sucker, or
spur. The disease spreads with great rapidity, by reason of which it is
easily told from winter-killing. Injury from cold is also more general,
and the foliage browns rather than blackens.

Pear-blight is an American disease, the history of which was briefly
given on page 51. Until recently it was confined to regions east of the
Rocky Mountains, but since about 1900 it has been a virulent epidemic
on the Pacific slope as well, and is now found from coast to coast
wherever pears are grown in North America. It seems not to be found in
the pear regions of other continents. It attacks the apple, quince,
and other pomes as well as the pear, and plant pathologists declare it
to be the most destructive disease attacking the pome-fruits. Trees in
the nursery suffer as well as those in the orchard. Every variety of
the pear bearing edible fruit is attacked. Fortunately, some sorts are
more immune than others. Kieffer, Seckel, Winter Nelis, and Duchesse
d'Angoulême are most resistant of standard varieties, while Bartlett,
Clapp Favorite, and Flemish Beauty are little resistant.

Pear-blight is caused by a bacterium, _Bacillus amylovorous_, the
discovery of which by Burrill in 1877 as a cause of this disease is
one of the landmarks in plant pathology. The organisms are dormant
during the winter, which they pass in the margins of blight-cankers
where moisture is sufficient to keep them alive. With the return of
vegetative growth, some sort of fermentation seems to set in and drops
of a thick, opaque liquid ooze out of the margins of blight-cankers.
These contain countless numbers of the blight bacteria which may
swarm into the healthy tissues adjoining, or be carried by any one of
the great number of kinds of insects which visit trees at flowering
time to the pear-blossoms, to growing tips, or to wounds in tender
bark. The pruner with his tools may be an unwilling agent in carrying
the bacteria from tree to tree. The organisms now multiply apace,
killing tissues wherever they find entrance and causing the several
manifestations of the disease described under symptoms. Were it not
that the bacteria are killed by sunlight and even brief periods of
drying, the life of the plants attacked would be the only limits of the
disease unless checked by man.

Theoretically, pear-blight can be controlled. Practically, pear-growers
fail to control it. Control consists in orchard sanitation whereby
the bacterium causing the disease is kept out of the orchard. This
proves all but impossible in the average orchard. Sometimes, without
doubt, the virulency of the disease is lessened. Possibly, if all
the recommendations of plant pathologists could be put in practice,
pear-growers would more often succeed in keeping blight down, but the
necessary sanitary measures require such watchful care and so great an
expense that few pear-growers can carry out the program for controlling
this disease. Of those who have studied methods of control and have
given advice on the subject, Hesler and Whetzel[24] are as reliable as
any and we quote herewith their recommendations:

 "In attempting to control fire-blight, the following important points
 should be borne in mind: (1) That the disease is caused by bacteria
 which gain entrance to the host tissues only through wounds, or
 punctures by insects, into succulent, rapidly growing tissues, or
 through the nectaries of the blossoms. (2) That insects of several
 kinds are the usual agents of inoculation. (3) That practically
 all pome fruit-growing sections in North America are infested, and
 therefore there is always a source from which the bacteria may be
 disseminated. (4) That all known varieties of the hosts, on which the
 blight organism occurs, are more or less susceptible; while some show
 resistance, none are wholly immune. Therefore control consists chiefly
 in the elimination of the pathogene from the infected trees. This is
 accomplished by a strict application of the following operations: (a)
 Inspect all pear trees in the autumn and again in the early spring
 before the blossoms open, and cut out and treat all cankers in the
 body and main limbs. With a sharp knife, or draw-shave, remove all the
 diseased tissue, wash the wound with corrosive sublimate (one tablet
 to one pint of water), and, when dry, paint the wound with coal-tar
 or lead paint, preferably the former. The wound-dressing will need
 renewal every year or so. (b) Throughout the summer, beginning with
 the fall of blossoms, make an inspection every few days of the young
 trees. Break out the blighted spurs and cut out diseased twigs, making
 the cut at least six inches below the diseased portion. Disinfect the
 cuts with corrosive sublimate. (c) Remove all watersprouts from the
 trees two or three times during the season. (d) In the nursery remove
 the blossom-buds, particularly of the quinces. Here inspection must
 be frequent, particularly in susceptible stock, in order to keep the
 disease under control. It is often necessary to inspect certain blocks
 daily, the diseased twigs being cut out as soon as observed. When
 budded stock of the first year becomes affected, the trees should be
 dug out, since cutting below the diseased area causes the trunk of the
 young tree to be crooked and therefore not marketable. (e) Control the
 insects. The real point of attack lies in this phase of the problem."

Scab (_Venturia pyrina_ Aderh.), after blight, is the best-known and
most prevalent disease of the pear in New York. Like blight, it is
found wherever pears are grown in North America, and also wherever
pears are grown in foreign countries. It attacks the pear at all ages
from the youngest to the oldest plant. Twigs, leaves, flowers, and
fruit suffer. A closely related and very similar fungus attacks the
apple and causes the apple-scab, but the two fungi are not the same and
do not spread from the one fruit to the other.

The name describes the disease at maturity so that all may know it.
Black, canker-like lesions spot the fruit, leaf, and twig. These are
most characteristic on the pear. The scabs first appear on the fruit
as olive-green velvety spots; the young fruits may drop; if they
persist, growth may cease, the skin crack, or the fruit be distorted;
the fruit-stalk is often shriveled. The scab shows on the leaves much
as on the fruit and usually attacks the lower surface. On the twigs the
scab is not so conspicuous, but appears as a small round spot which
may or may not slough off and be replaced by healthy bark. Young twigs
are most often attacked, in which case the scabby spots suggest scale
insects.

Pear-scab is caused by a fungus. The chief life events of this fungus
must be known to control the disease. The organism passes the winter
in leaves on the ground. In the spring, the spores which have matured
in the spore-cases are forcibly discharged, and, being very light, are
carried hither and thither by the wind so that some of them reach the
opening flower and leaf-buds. If moisture and heat are sufficient, the
spores germinate, and an infection is started. A foothold secured, the
germ-tubes branch and form a dense mycelium--the velvety layer visible
to the unaided eye. From these masses of mycelium spore-stalks arise in
great numbers bearing countless spores which by one agent and another
are carried to other leaves, twigs, or blossoms for new infections. New
infections continue throughout the growing season. The black scab spots
on fruit and leaf are corky layers of tissue formed to heal the wounds
made by the fungus which has ceased to grow vigorously in these scabs.
The fungus may pass the winter on the twigs as well as in fallen leaves.

Different varieties resist the scab-fungus differently. Flemish Beauty
and Summer Doyenné are most susceptible and in seasons favorable to the
fungus seldom present fruits with a clean cheek no matter how careful
the treatment. Pruning off badly infected twigs and plowing under
scabby leaves are good sanitary measures. In New York, two applications
of lime and sulphur at the summer strength, if applied annually,
are usually sufficient to control the fungus. The first of these
applications should be made when the blossoms show color, a few days
before they open. The second should be put on when most of the petals
have fallen. In seasons favorable to the scab, a third application two
weeks after the second may be the means of saving the crop. The spread
of the disease is greatly favored by damp warm weather.

Pear-growers are plagued by two leaf-spots, one of which is also known
as leaf-blight. The leaf-spot here to be discussed (_Mycosphærella
sentina_ (Fr.) Schroet.) is sometimes called the ashy leaf-spot. The
disease is not often seriously troublesome in New York, but is capable
of doing great damage in both the nursery and orchard. The spots which
give name to the disease are conspicuous enough, but even when present
in great numbers are often not seen by the pear-grower until there is a
premature dropping of the leaves in August or earlier. The trees often
put out new growths, with the result that the wood does not ripen and
the tree is left in no condition to stand the cold of winter in this
northern climate.

As with nearly all diseases of plants, some varieties suffer more
than others. Sheldon, Seckel, and Flemish Beauty are more injured
than Kieffer, Lawrence, and Mount Vernon. Nursery stock is more often
injured the second than the first year set. Only the leaves suffer.
The fungus first shows its work in minute purplish spots on the upper
surface of the leaf. The mature spots measure about one-sixth of an
inch in diameter, are angular in shape, with well-defined margins, and
have an outer zone of brownish-purple, with a grayish center. Late
in the season, dots, the spore-cases of the fungus, appear in the
gray central area. The fungus passes the winter in diseased leaves
which fall to the ground in late summer. From these leaves spores
are discharged into the air to be carried to the leaves after growth
begins in the spring. The disease is usually controlled by the sprays
necessary every year to keep pear-scab in submission. In the nursery,
two-year-old trees are sprayed just after the new leaves open and twice
thereafter at two-week intervals. One-year-olds seldom need to be
sprayed.

Leaf-blight (_Fabræa maculata_ (Lev.) Atk.) is a common and destructive
fungus in pear-nurseries in New York and is sometimes troublesome in
orchards. The quince suffers even more than the pear from this fungus.
In the nursery, leaves and twigs are attacked, and in the orchard the
pears themselves sometimes suffer. The disease appears in the spring
as minute, reddish-brown circular spots on the upper surface of the
leaves, but the fungus penetrates through to the lower surface as
the disease progresses. Eventually the color changes to dark brown,
and later a coal-black, raised spot appears in the center. The spots
sometimes run together. Young leaves shrivel under the attacks of
the fungus; while old ones, if badly diseased, turn yellow and drop
prematurely. Twigs and leaf-stalks are frequently girdled, and the
lesions are more elongated. The spots are similar on the fruits to
those on the leaves. The fungus spends the winter in fallen leaves. In
the spring the spores are discharged from the fruiting organs of the
fungi and are carried to the tender leaf or twig of the pear or quince.
The parasite begins growth at once and in about a month a new crop of
spores develop. This fungus grows on various other pome-fruits which
complicates remedial measures. The treatment recommended for leaf-spot
should control leaf-blight.

As are all tree-fruits in New York, the pear is attacked by crown-gall
(_Bacterium tumefaciens_ Smith & Townsend). This disease, however, is
seldom a serious menace to orchard trees this far north, but the vigor
of nursery stock is sapped when the galls girdle the tap-root or the
stem at the collar. Moreover, trees affected by crown-gall are barred
in most states by inspection laws so that nurserymen can ill afford to
produce gall-infected trees. It is a wise precaution not to plant badly
diseased trees. The galls are tumor-like structures on the roots of
the plant, or often at the juncture of root and stem. They vary from
the size of a pea to that of a large egg, forming at maturity rough,
knotty, dark-colored masses. Another form of the disease appears as a
dense tangle of hair-like roots arising from callous-like galls. This
form passes under the name "hairy root." Neither preventive nor cure
is known. Orchard or nursery should not be planted on ground known to
have been infected as the disease is highly contagious. The brambles,
especially raspberries, are common carriers of crown-gall, and none of
the brambles should be planted as inter-crops in pear-orchards.

Brown-blotch (_Leptothyrium pomi_ (Mont. & Fr.) Sacc. var.) is another
fungus which is sometimes troublesome. The fungus causes reddish
blotches on the fruit which coalesce into rusty-brown patches often
covering the whole surface of the pear. Here, again, the Kieffer
suffers most although fruits of other varieties are often disfigured by
the blotch. The disease is most common on heavy soils and in densely
shaded trees. Pruning to let in the sun is usually sufficient to keep
the fungus in check, but a late application of lime and sulphur is
often necessary.

Black mold (_Fumago vagans_ Fr.), a fungus which grows in the honey-dew
exuded by the nymphs of the pear-psylla, sometimes causes a sooty
covering of the pears which spoils their sale. Twigs and leaves are
also covered with thin superficial growth of the fungus somewhat to the
detriment of growth. The remedy is obvious--control the psylla.

Pink-rot (_Cephalothecium roseum_ Cda.) sometimes does much damage to
pears in common or cold storage. The fungus seems able to enter the
skin of pears only through injuries, and when reasonable care is used
in handling the fruit the rot does little damage. Not infrequently it
is found on fruits unpicked, having entered the skin through ruptures
made by pear-scab, black-spot, or other fungi. This, of course, seldom
happens in well-sprayed orchards.


                      INSECTS ATTACKING THE PEAR

Several insect pests are very destructive to pear-trees, as many more
are often troublesome, while perhaps in addition to the dozen that must
always or occasionally be combatted some thirty or forty more have
been listed as pear-pests. Young pear-trees are very susceptible to
injuries of any kind and if beset by any of the common insect pests do
not prosper. As the trees come to maturity, life and vigor of the tree
may not be endangered by any but two or three of the worst pests, but
the crop is always cut short by infestations of insects on any part of
the plant which interferes with the normal life of the tree. The pests
most destructive to the pear in New York, about in order of importance,
are San Jose scale, psylla, codling-moth, pear-slug, and pear-leaf
blister-mite.

San Jose scale (_Aspidiotus perniciosus_ Comstock) is particularly
harmful to tree and fruit of the pear. The pears, possibly, are
malformed more and show the scales with their discoloration more
plainly than the product of any other fruit-tree. A scale-infested
pear-tree is easily recognized. Dead and dying twigs or branches and
moribund trees are evidences of the dreaded pest. Examination shows
the moribund parts to be covered with myriads of minute scales which
give the infected bark a scurfy, ashy look. A reddish discoloration
is discovered if the bark be cut or scraped. A foothold gained on
trunk or branch, fruit and foliage are soon infected. Reproduction is
continuous throughout the summer, and the scales increase by leaps
and bounds. Smooth-barked young trees succumb within three or four
years if the insects are unchecked; the rougher-barked old trees
survive the pest indefinitely, although the vigor is lessened to the
point of unproductiveness in many old orchards. Pear-growers find the
lime-sulphur solution applied in the dormant season the most effective
spray in combating San Jose scale. Several insect enemies of the scale
help to keep the pest down. A quarter-century ago, it was feared that
the pear industry of the State might be ruined by San Jose scale, but
no energetic fruit-grower now fears the pest.

Next to San Jose scale, psylla is the most feared pest of the pear
in New York. Indeed, this insect is much more difficult to combat
successfully than scale, and were it as wide-spread, the pear industry
in New York would be hard hit. The psylla is a minute, sucking
insect, wingless in its immature stages, but winged and very active
as an adult. They are nearly related to plant-lice, and like them
suck the juices of the buds and new leaves. Like plant-lice also
they reproduce very rapidly. The immature insects secrete a sticky
honey-dew which becomes blackened with a fungus, and the presence of
this blackish, sticky substance on foliage and branches is usually
the first indication of the pest. The adult is about one-tenth inch
long, with four membranous wings, the body dark in color and showing
brownish-black markings. Seen through a hand lens, the mature insects
look like tiny cicadas. The adults hibernate in crevices of the bark,
and at the time buds are swelling in the spring come out to lay their
eggs. The eggs hatch in two or three weeks, and there may be four
or five broods in a season. The pest is best controlled by spraying
with such contact insecticides as tobacco extract both to kill the
hibernating insects and later the immature psylla. The winter strength
of lime-sulphur solution will kill the eggs.

The apple-worm, the larva of the codling moth (_Carpocapsa pomonella_
Linnaeus), destroys great quantities of pears year in and year out in
New York, causing greater monetary loss to pear-growers than any other
insect pest. The worm and its work scarcely need description--all
know "wormy" apples and pears and the agent of the mischief. A
pinkish-white, fleshy worm eats a cavity within the pear, usually
through and around the core, and then eats its way out to the surface,
after which it finds suitable shelter in a crevice of the bark and
spins its cocoon. About the time apples blossom the larvae transform
into small brown pupae, from which small moths emerge in two or three
weeks. The moths are coppery-brown, small, with a wing expanse of about
three-quarters inch, and very inconspicuous as they rest during the
day on the bark of the pear-tree which they closely resemble; they fly
only at dusk. The moth lays its eggs on leaves or the fruit itself and
the young larvae immediately begin work on the nearest pear. Control
consists in spraying with arsenate of lead. Two and sometimes three
sprayings are necessary. The most important spraying is made just after
the blossoms fall, while the calyx-cup is still open, so that the
poison will lodge in the blossom-end of the upturned pear. Codling moth
was once a most serious pest of the pear, but is now easily kept under
control by seasonal applications of arsenate of lead.

The pear-slug (_Caliroa cerasi_ Linnaeus), a generation ago, before
spraying was common, did much damage to the pear in New York, but is
now a negligible pest except in the orchards of the indifferent or
slothful since it is easily controlled by spraying. The slugs are
small, dark green shiny creatures which eat the surface of the leaves
of pear, cherry, and plum. They devour the upper surface of the leaf
leaving the veins and the tissues of the lower surface, which turn
brown so that the infested tree has the aspect of having been scorched
by fire. The slugs molt and finally lose their shiny coat and dirty
green color, the full-grown larvae becoming clear yellow. The adult is
one of the numerous saw-flys. Eggs are laid within the tissues of the
leaves. There are two or three generations in a season. The slugs are
most common in the hottest part of the summer or late in the summer.
This pest is easily kept in check by applications of arsenate of lead.

The foliage of the pear, in common with that of the apple, is often
seriously injured by a mite (_Eriophyes pyri_ Pgst.) which burrows into
the tissues of the leaves. The mites attack the young leaves causing
reddish blisters which turn black. The blisters are thickened spots
which are found to have a corky texture. The young fruits are sometimes
attacked, in which case they are badly malformed. The mites are of
microscopic size and can be seen only by the aid of a magnifying glass.
They hibernate under the scales of the leaf-buds, and are thus ready to
attack the young leaves as soon as they unfold, which they do by eating
their way in from the under side and then by their work cause the
characteristic swellings. As they mature, the mites come out and move
to new places and start more colonies. In the autumn, they find their
way to the maturing buds and go into winter quarters. An application
of lime-sulphur solution at winter strength usually disposes of the
mites; that put on for San Jose scale suffices for this pest also.
Summer sprays do not reach the mites as they are then hidden within the
leaves. The pest was once a serious menace to the pear, but with the
advent of winter spraying has become of small importance.

Of the numerous other insects which occasionally become serious pests
of the pear, at least twenty have been troublesome at one time or
another in New York. Space does not permit a description of these minor
pests--they are named as a matter of record. It is not necessary to
give remedies for them, as all are controlled by the treatment of major
pests which in most orchards need annual applications of one spray or
another.

Several scale insects, other than San Jose scale, are more or less
pestiferous in the pear-orchards of this State; commonest of these
is the oyster-shell, which not infrequently does serious damage to
young and unhealthy trees. The scurfy scale found chiefly on the apple
sometimes becomes a pest on the pear. A hemispherical scale, about
one-twelfth of an inch in length, known as the terrapin scale, now
and then infests the pear, but is seldom if ever harmful. As a rule,
the treatment for San Jose scale keeps all other scales in check,
but all are more difficult to kill than the San Jose and in cases of
troublesome infestations may require drastic treatment with a contact
insecticide.

A great number of chewing insects, as distinguished from sucking
insects, defoliate the pear when given an opportunity, but are kept in
check by the treatment for codling moth. The much-dreaded browntail
moth and gypsy moth now have a foothold in the State, but as yet
can hardly be called pests although their advent threatens the pear
industry as it does all other orchard industries. The bud-moth, seldom
seen in well-cared-for orchards, is sometimes a vexatious visitor in
pear-orchards. Three species of caterpillars, all most striking in
appearance, the larval stages of tussock moths, infest pear-trees.
These are the white-marked tussock moth, the rusty tussock moth, and
the definite-marked tussock moth.

The pear-tree has its share of borers. A small, dark brown beetle,
about one-third of an inch in length, the apple twig-borer, sometimes
does considerable damage to young shoots of the pear. The flat-headed
apple-tree borer works in the sap wood of the pear as in the apple.
The shot-hole borer, a tiny insect, eats a small round hole in the
trunk of the pear, as it does also in several fruits, but does little
damage except in devitalized trees. The shot-borer, a tiny black
beetle, one-tenth of an inch long, bores into twigs or small branches
and sooner or later causes their death. None of these borers are
very harmful on the pear in New York, but all must be reckoned with
occasionally. All are difficult to control.

The pear thrips attack the newly opening flower- and leaf-buds and
when the insect, a small winged creature with sucking mouth-parts, is
abundant much damage is done. This pest in New York is chiefly confined
to the Hudson River Valley. The European grain aphis, closely related
to the destructive apple aphis, is sometimes a serious pest on pears.
Both of these pests are comparatively easily controlled by timely
applications of contact insecticides.

Lastly, there are several chewing insects which feed on the leaves of
the pear, which, unless checked, sometimes become major pests for a
season or two in an orchard here and there. All of them, fortunately,
are controlled by the arsenical poisons which are necessary to keep
the codling moth down. The pests are: Cigar case-bearer, green fruit
worm, pistol case-bearer, and oblique-banded leaf-roller. With these,
as with most of the other pests of the pear, cultivation to keep down
all foreign vegetation, and orchard sanitation, consisting chiefly of
the destruction of infested fruit, foliage, or wood, are essential
preventives.




                              CHAPTER IV

                      LEADING VARIETIES OF PEARS


                            ANDRÉ DESPORTES

This old French sort is sparingly grown in New York, and is still
listed by a few American nurserymen. The pears are handsome and very
good in quality, but they quickly soften at the center and neither
keep nor ship well. While usually of medium size, or sometimes large,
the pears often run small. The variety is well worth planting in a
collection, but has no value in a commercial plantation, and there are
many better sorts for home orchards.

[Illustration: ANDRÉ DESPORTES]

The parent tree of this variety grew in the seed beds of M. André
Leroy, the well-known authority on pomology, at Angers, France. M.
Leroy obtained it in 1854 from pips of Williams' Bon Chrétien, or as
it is better known here, the Bartlett pear. He named it after the son
of M. Baptiste Desportes, manager of the business department of his
establishment. The vigor and high quality of the fruit were quickly
appreciated, and the variety was soon disseminated far and wide.

 Tree characteristically upright and vigorous, rapid-growing, hardy,
 productive; branches slender, smooth, light brown overlaid with thin,
 grayish scarf-skin, marked with small lenticels; branchlets thick,
 long, with short internodes, reddish-brown, slightly streaked toward
 the tips with ash-gray scarf-skin, dull, smooth, glabrous, with
 numerous small, but very conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds large, pointed, plump, appressed. Leaves 2-3/4 in. long,
 1-5/8 in. wide, ovate, stiff, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin
 glandular, slightly crenate; petiole 1-1/2 in. long. Flower-buds
 large, long, conical, plump, free, arranged singly as lateral buds or
 on short spurs; flowers showy, 1-1/4 in. across, occasionally tinged
 pink, in dense clusters, averaging 9 flowers per cluster; pedicels 3/4
 in. long, thick, pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in August; medium in size, 2-7/8 in. long, 2-1/4 in. wide,
 obovate-obtuse-pyriform, symmetrical, uniform; stem 1 in. long, thick,
 curved; cavity obtuse, shallow, dotted with russet, often lipped;
 calyx small, open; lobes separated at the base, short, narrow, acute;
 basin shallow, narrow, obtuse, gently furrowed, symmetrical; skin
 thin, tender, smooth; color dull greenish-yellow, dotted and marbled
 with reddish-brown, blushed on the sunny side; dots numerous, small,
 light colored, obscure; flesh tinged with yellow, fine, tender and
 melting, buttery, juicy, sweet, aromatic; quality very good. Core
 large, closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide,
 conical; seeds small, wide, plump, acute.

                                ANSAULT

 =1.= _Am. Pom. Soc. Cat._ 36. 1883. =2.= _Can. Hort._ =24=:454, fig.

 _Bonne du Puits-Ansault._ =3.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:486, fig. 1867.
 =4.= Downing _Fr. Trees Am._ 1st App. 123, fig. 1872. =5.= _Am. Pom.
 Soc. Cat._ 34. 1877.

Well grown, the fruits of Ansault rival those of Seckel in quality.
In particular, the flesh is notable, and is described by the term
_buttery_, so common in pear parlance, rather better than that of any
other pear. The rich sweet flavor, and distinct but delicate perfume
contribute to make the fruits of highest quality. Unfortunately, the
pears are not very attractive in appearance. They are small, and the
green coat, nearly covered with russet dots and markings, is dull,
though enlivened somewhat at full maturity by a rich yellow. The tree
in good pear soils is vigorous, productive, bears annually, and is not
more subject to blight than that of the average variety. While not at
all suitable for commercial orchards, Ansault should find a place in
every collection of pears for home use.

The pear Bonne du Puits-Ansault was raised from seed in the nurseries
of M. André Leroy, Angers, France. The parent tree bore fruit in
1863, and M. Leroy states that the name which it bears is that of the
enclosure where it was first raised. It was propagated in 1865. The
American Pomological Society first listed this variety in its catalog
in 1877, and in 1883 shortened the name to its present form.

 Tree large, upright-spreading, hardy, very productive; trunk stocky,
 shaggy; branches thick, dull brownish-red, tinged with green and
 heavily covered with greenish scarf-skin, with numerous raised
 lenticels; branchlets long, reddish-brown, with traces of gray
 scarf-skin, smooth, glabrous, with few inconspicuous, small, slightly
 raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds plump, pointed, nearly free. Leaf-scars prominent. Leaves
 numerous, 2-3/4 in. long, 1-1/2 in. wide, ovate or broadly oval,
 leathery; apex abruptly pointed; margin finely serrate, with small,
 reddish, sharp-pointed glands; petiole 1-1/2 in. long, slender,
 glabrous. Fruit-buds large, conical, plump, free; flowers 1-1/8 in.
 across, in dense clusters, 7 to 9 flowers in a cluster; pedicels 5/8
 in. long, thick, greenish, lightly pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in late September and early October; medium in size, 2-3/8
 in. long, 2-1/8 in. wide, uniform, obtuse-obovate-pyriform, irregular;
 stem 5/8 in. long, short, thick; cavity obtuse, russeted, furrowed,
 ribbed; calyx partly open, large; lobes acute; basin somewhat abrupt,
 furrowed and wrinkled; skin roughened with russet markings and dots;
 color pale yellow, considerably russeted about the basin and cavity
 with russet dots, with scattered flecks and patches of russet; dots
 numerous, small, russet; flesh tinged with yellow, granular at the
 center, melting and tender, buttery, very juicy, sweet, aromatic;
 quality good to very good. Core closed, axile, the core-lines
 clasping; calyx-tube long, narrow, funnel-shaped; seeds rather short,
 plump, obtuse.

Bartlett leads all other pears in number of trees in New York, and
vies with Kieffer for the greatest number in America. Its fruits are
more common and more popular in American markets than those of any
other pear. When the characters of the variety are passed in review,
although several poor ones of fruit and tree appear, the popularity
of Bartlett with growers and sellers, if not with consumers, seems
justified. As with the leading variety of any fruit, the preëminently
meritorious character of this one is its great adaptability to
different climates, soils, and situations. Thus, Bartlett is grown
with profit in every pear-growing region in America and in all is
grown in greater quantities than any other sort excepting, perhaps,
the notorious Kieffer. Another character which commends this variety
to pear-growers is fruitfulness--barring frosts or freezes, the trees
bear full crops year after year. Moreover, the trees are very vigorous,
attain large size, bear young, live long, are easily managed in the
orchard, and thrive on both standard and quince stocks. The pears are
large, handsome, of good but not of the best quality, and keep and ship
remarkably well.

Bartlett is not without serious faults, however. The trees blight
badly, and are not much above the average in resistance to blight, the
black plague of the pear. Neither are they as hardy to cold or to heat
as those of some other varieties. They are scarcely hardier to cold
than those of the peach, and cannot withstand the summer heat of the
southern, or of the Mississippi Valley states. Another serious defect
of the trees is that, more than those of any other standard variety,
their blossoms require cross-fertilization. The fruits are satisfactory
in all characters excepting quality. There are many better-flavored
pears. The fruits lack the rich, perfumed flavor of Seckel on one
hand, and the piquant, vinous taste of Winter Nelis on the other. But
the pears are much above the average in quality, and since no other
variety is so easily grown, nor so reliable in the markets, Bartlett
promises long to continue its supremacy for home and commercial
plantations. After Kieffer, it is the most desired of all pears by
the canning trade. Bartlett is the parent of several other well-known
varieties, and of many sorts of small importance.

This pear was found as a wilding by a Mr. Stair, a schoolmaster
at Aldermaston, Berkshire, England. From him it was acquired by a
Mr. Williams, a nurseryman at Turnham Green, Middlesex, and as it
was propagated and distributed by him it became known by his name,
although it is still known as Stair's pear at Aldermaston. It was
brought to this country in 1797 or 1799 by James Carter of Boston
for Thomas Brewer who planted the variety in his grounds at Roxbury,
Massachusetts, under the name of Williams' Bon Chrétien, by which name
it was then and still is known both in England and France. In 1817
Enoch Bartlett, Dorchester, Massachusetts, became possessed of the
Brewer estate, and not knowing its true name allowed the pear to go
out under his own. Henceforth it was known in America as Bartlett. The
American Pomological Society added this variety to its catalog-list of
fruits in 1848.

 Tree medium in size, tall, pyriform, upright, hardy, very productive;
 branches stocky, smooth, reddish-brown overlaid with ash-gray
 scarf-skin, with few lenticels; branchlets short, with short
 internodes, reddish-brown, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with conspicuous
 lenticles.

 Leaf-buds short, obtuse, pointed, mostly free; leaf-scars prominent.
 Leaves 2-3/4 in. long, 1-2/5 in. wide, oval, leathery; apex
 taper-pointed; margin tipped with small dark red glands, finely
 serrate; petiole 1-3/4 in. long. Flower-buds large, conical, pointed,
 free; flowers showy, 1-1/4 in. across, in dense clusters averaging
 7 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1-1/8 in. long, slender, slightly
 pubescent.

 Fruit matures in September; large, 3-3/8 in. long, 2-3/8 in. wide,
 oblong-obtuse-pyriform, tapering toward the apex, symmetrical,
 uniform; stem 1-1/8 in. long, often curved, thick; cavity small,
 usually lipped, with thin, overspreading streaks of light russet,
 acute, shallow; calyx partly open; lobes separated at the base,
 narrow, acute; basin very shallow, narrow, obtuse, furrowed and
 wrinkled; skin thin, tender, smooth, often dull, the surface somewhat
 uneven; color clear yellow, with a faint blush on the exposed cheek,
 more or less dotted with russet and often thinly russeted around
 the basin; dots many, small, conspicuous, greenish-russet; flesh
 fine-grained although slightly granular at the center, melting,
 buttery, very juicy, vinous, aromatic; quality very good. Core
 large, closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube long, wide,
 funnel-shaped; seeds wide, plump, acute.

This good old pear has been a standard autumn sort for nearly a
century. The internal characters of both flesh and flavor are
nearly perfect, but externally much more might be desired as to
shape and size. In flesh and flavor, the fruits are of the Bergamot
type--fine-grained, buttery, juicy, and sugary, with a musky taste
and perfume. The fruits are not as large as is desirable, and are
variable in shape and color, external defects which a rather handsome
color offsets in part. The trees are more satisfactory than the
fruits. They bear enormously and almost annually on either standard
or dwarfing stocks; they are very vigorous, with a somewhat distinct
upright-spreading habit of growth; are hardier than the average variety
of this fruit; and are rather more resistant to blight than the average
variety. The fruits are too small for a good commercial product, but
their delectable flavor and luscious flesh make them as desirable as
any other pear for home use; besides which the trees grow so well, and
are so easily managed that the variety becomes one of the very best for
the home planter.

Belle Lucrative is of Flemish origin. In 1831 it was growing in the
London Horticultural Society's gardens at Chiswick, and was then
described by Lindley as "another of the new Flemish pears." It had
been taken to England by a Mr. Braddick who received the cions from M.
Stoffels of Mechlin. By some writers it is considered probable that
it originated with M. Stoffels, but the leading Belgian and French
writers say that it was raised by Major Espéren, also of Mechlin, about
1827. In this country it first fruited in the Pomological Garden of
Robert Manning, Salem, Massachusetts, in 1835 or 1836. The American
Pomological Society added the variety to its fruit catalog-list in 1852
under the name Belle Lucrative.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped,
 rapid-growing, hardy, productive; branches smooth, grayish-brown
 mingled with red, covered with scarf-skin, with numerous elongated
 lenticels; branchlets slender, short, light brown, glossy, smooth,
 glabrous, with few small, inconspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, conical, pointed, plump, appressed. Leaves 3
 in. long, 1-1/2 in. wide, stiff; apex abruptly pointed; margin finely
 serrate, tipped with very small, sharp glands; petiole 2 in. long.
 Flower-buds conical, pointed, plump, free, singly on very short
 spurs; flowers with an unpleasant odor, showy, 1-1/2 in. across,
 average 7 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1-1/16 in. long, thick, thinly
 pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in late September and October; medium in size, 2-3/8 in.
 long, 2-1/4 in. wide, obovate, conical, with sides unequal; stem 1-1/8
 in. long; cavity very shallow and narrow, or lacking, the flesh drawn
 up about the base of the stem; calyx open, large; lobes long, narrow,
 acuminate; basin shallow, obtuse, smooth; skin thin, tender, smooth;
 color dull greenish-yellow, thickly sprinkled with small, russet dots,
 often overspread with russet around the basin; dots numerous, small,
 russet, conspicuous; flesh tinged with yellow, firm, fine-grained,
 crisp, buttery, juicy, sweet; quality very good. Core closed, abaxile;
 calyx-tube long, narrow, funnel-shaped; seeds narrow, plump, acute.

Beurré d'Anjou is a standard market pear for late fall and early
winter, its season lasting until well into January even in common
storage. As an early winter pear, it has no superior and few equals in
appearance and quality of fruit. In appearance, the pear is of distinct
type--large, very uniform, the sides slightly unequal, smooth of skin,
yellow, marked and dotted with russet, faintly blushed, and borne on a
very short, thick stem. A fruit of this variety can never be mistaken
for that of another. The internal characters are scarcely less notable
than the external ones. The yellowish-white flesh is firm but tender,
slightly granular, very juicy, sweet, spicy, with a rich, vinous
flavor. Uniformity of shape and the smooth skin are marked and constant
characters. In common with all varieties, the fruits of this pear are
not always up to their best, but they are never poor in quality. The
trees are vigorous, hardy, fairly free from blight, grow rapidly and
come in bearing early, but have the serious fault of being uncertain
croppers. In Europe and America, the trees thrive on the quince, and
the variety is rated by all as a splendid one for dwarfing. Of all
winter pears, none is more valuable for commercial or home orchards
than Beurré d'Anjou. In particular, it is recommended for New York,
where, possibly, it is more at home than in any other part of America.

Beurré d'Anjou is an old French pear the origin of which is obscure,
although it is supposed to have originated in the vicinity of Angers.
Early in the nineteenth century it was introduced into England by
Thomas Rivers, noted author and pomologist. The variety was introduced
into this country by Colonel Wilder[25] of Boston about 1842, and first
fruited with him in 1845. The American Pomological Society added Beurré
d'Anjou to its list of fruits recommended for general cultivation in
1852.

 Tree large, vigorous, spreading, hardy, an uncertain bearer; trunk
 smooth; branches slightly zigzag, covered with gray scarf-skin over
 reddish-brown, with few small lenticels; branchlets long, with long
 internodes, reddish-brown tinged with green, smooth, glabrous, with
 many conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, obtuse, nearly free. Leaves 3-1/2 in. long,
 1-1/2 in. wide, elongated-oval, thin, leathery; apex taper-pointed;
 margin nearly entire or crenate; petiole 2 in. long. Flower-buds
 large, long, conical, plump, free; flowers 1-3/8 in. across, showy, in
 dense clusters, from 8 to 12 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1/2 in. long,
 very thick, pubescent, green.

 Fruit ripe November to early January; large, 3-1/2 in. long, 3
 in. wide, uniform in size, oblong-obovate-pyriform, with surface
 irregular in outline, sides slightly unequal, uniform in shape; stem
 1/2 in. long, short, very thick and woody; cavity obtuse, shallow,
 russeted and furrowed, usually lipped; calyx open; lobes separated
 at the base, long, narrow, acuminate; basin shallow, narrow, obtuse,
 smooth, symmetrical and regular; skin thin, tender, smooth, dull;
 color yellow, clouded with russet around the basin and occasionally
 with very fine russet lines and markings; dots many, small, russet,
 conspicuous; flesh yellowish-white, firm, but slightly granular,
 tender, buttery, very juicy, sweet and spicy, with a rich, aromatic
 flavor; quality very good. Core large, closed; core-lines clasping;
 calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds large, wide, long, plump,
 acuminate, tufted at the tips.

In favorable locations this pear seems to possess all of the characters
which constitute a first-class fruit; but, notwithstanding, although
it has been in the country nearly a century, it is now scarcely to be
found in the nurseries, and orchard trees are becoming rare. The fruits
are distinguished by their refreshing, vinous taste and long-keeping
qualities. Very often, however, they do not ripen in eastern America,
and when not properly ripened the pears are highly acidulous and so
astringent as to be almost intolerable to the taste. The frequency
with which these poor fruits are borne, always on heavy, cold clays
and in cold climates, coupled with rather small, short-lived trees,
condemn the variety for most pear regions in the East. In the far West,
the crop ripens better, and the pears are splendid winter fruits. The
merits of the variety are so varying in New York that it is not now
worth while attempting to bring it into new life.

Beurré d'Arenberg, in the opinion of some European writers, holds first
place among the pears produced by French and Belgian pomologists.
Unfortunately, Beurré d'Arenberg and Glou Morceau are often mistaken
the one for the other. Beurré d'Arenberg was raised by Monseigneur
Deschamps, Abbé of the Orphan Hospital, Enghien, Belgium. At about the
same time, M. Noisette, a nurseryman of Paris, sent out Glou Morceau,
which he had procured from the gardens of the Duc d'Arenberg, under
the name Beurré d'Arenberg, so that there were two distinct varieties
in cultivation under the same name. The true Beurré d'Arenberg of the
Abbé Deschamps came to this country about 1827, having been sent over
by Thomas Andrew Knight, President of the London Horticultural Society,
to the Hon. John Lowell of Boston. The American Pomological Society
recommended this variety for cultivation in 1848, but in 1871 the name
disappeared from the Society's catalog.

 Tree medium in size and vigor, upright, very hardy and very
 productive; trunk and branches medium in thickness and smoothness;
 branchlets slender, short, light brown mingled with green, smooth,
 glabrous, with numerous, small, raised lenticels. Leaf-buds small,
 short, plump, free; leaf-scars with prominent shoulders. Leaves 3 in.
 long; 1-3/8 in. wide; apex taper-pointed; margin glandless, finely
 serrate; petiole 1-7/8 in. long. Flower-buds small, short, sharply
 pointed, free, singly on short spurs.

 Fruit ripe December to January; large, obovate-pyriform, ribbed;
 stem 1 in. long, thick, fleshy at the base, obliquely inserted;
 cavity lacking, drawn up in an oblique lip about the stem; calyx
 small, closed; lobes short, sometimes lacking; basin deep, smooth;
 skin roughish, thick, uneven; color yellow, with patches and
 tracings of russet especially around the calyx end; dots numerous,
 cinnamon-russet; flesh white, very juicy, melting, vinous or
 acidulous; quality very good. Core large; seeds large, roundish, plump.

The fruits of Beurré Bosc merit unqualified praise. They are nearly
flawless in every character. The pears at once receive approbation from
all who see them by virtue of their uniquely beautiful color and shape,
in which characters they are wholly unlike any other pear. The shape
is pyriform, with a very long, tapering neck, perfectly symmetrical
and unequalled in trimness of contour. The color is a dark rich yellow
overspread with cinnamon-russet, with here and there a spot of the
yellow ground color visible. The quality is rated by all as "very
good" or "best;" the Seckel alone surpasses it as a dessert fruit
in the estimation of most pear fanciers. The flesh, while slightly
granular, is tender and melting or almost buttery, very juicy, with
a rich piquant flavor and a pleasing aroma. The fruits seldom crack,
scab, or mildew. The characters of the tree fall far short of those
of the fruits. Nurserymen complain that it is difficult to propagate
the trees as they make a poor growth in the nursery and come to
transplanting age with a root system of two or three prongs almost
devoid of fibrous roots. The trees must be humored in soil and climate,
and under favorable conditions make but moderate growth as young
plants. Established trees in suitable soils, however, surpass most of
their neighbors in size and luxuriance of foliage. Very old trees
have a nobility of aspect possessed by few other pears. While slow in
coming in bearing, after fruiting begins the trees bear regularly and
abundantly. The variety does not succeed well on the quince unless
double-worked. Unfortunately, the trees are tender to cold and somewhat
too susceptible to blight. Beurré Bosc has long been a favorite in the
pear regions of Europe and America, and its culture in this country may
be recommended for the home, for local and general markets, and for
exportation.

This pear is a native of Belgium, having been raised from seed in
1807 by Dr. Van Mons, the renowned pomologist of Louvain, and was in
the first instance named by him Calebasse Bosc in honor of M. Bosc, a
distinguished French naturalist. In 1820, it was received at the garden
of the Horticultural Society of London under the name Beurré Bosc, and
Robert Thompson, at that time Director of the gardens, thought it best
to retain this name. The variety was early introduced into France.
About 1832 or 1833, Robert Manning and William Kenrick received cions
in the United States from Van Mons and from the London Horticultural
Society. The variety was cataloged by the American Pomological Society
at its first meeting in 1848.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, productive,
 not an early bearer; trunk stocky; branches smooth, brownish, covered
 with ash-gray scarf-skin, with large lenticels; branchlets brownish,
 tinged with gray, glossy, smooth, nearly glabrous, with slightly
 raised, conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds obtuse, pointed, appressed; leaf-scars prominent. Leaves 3
 in. long, 1-7/8 in. wide, ovate, thick, leathery; apex taper-pointed;
 margin finely crenate; petiole 1-1/4 in. long. Flower-buds large,
 conical, pointed, free; flowers open early, 1-1/2 in. across, showy,
 in dense clusters, from 10 to 20 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1 in.
 long, slightly pubescent, light green.

 Fruit ripe in late October and November; large, 3-3/8 in. long, 2-3/4
 in. wide, uniform in size, acute-obovate-pyriform, with a very long,
 tapering neck, uniform in shape and very symmetrical; stem 1-1/2 in.
 long, curved; cavity very obtuse or lacking, occasionally very shallow
 and narrow, wrinkled, russeted, with a fleshy ring folded up around
 the stem, slightly lipped; calyx open, small; lobes short, broad,
 obtuse; basin very shallow, narrow, obtuse, smooth, symmetrical;
 skin slightly granular, tender, roughened by russet, dull; color
 dark yellow, overspread with thick, dark russet, laid on in streaks
 and patches, with a cheek of solid russet; dots small, light russet,
 obscure; flesh yellowish-white, slightly granular, tender and melting,
 buttery, very juicy, with a rich, delicious, aromatic flavor; quality
 very good to best. Core large, closed, with clasping core-lines;
 calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds wide, short, plump, obtuse.

Beurré Clairgeau is one of the mainstays in American pear-growing, and
is an especially valuable variety in New York. It maintains its place
among standard varieties chiefly because of splendid tree-characters,
as the fruits, while handsome, are not of the best quality. The tree
is second only to that of Buffum in vigor, health, and productiveness,
and is nearly as handsome as an ornamental. It does equally well on
quince or pear stock, although the Europeans maintain that the product
is better on the dwarfing stock. On either stock, the trees bear young
and annually. The fruits are large, smooth, symmetrical, and uniform
in shape, with a handsome ground color of rich yellow at maturity
and a bright crimson cheek. But here praises end, for the "deceptive
cheek of the Clairgeau" is proverbial in pear-growing, the handsome
coat covering rather coarse, granular flesh which is sometimes very
good but more often commonplace. The core is very large, and the
flesh surrounding it often rots or softens prematurely. The fruit is
more suitable for cookery than dessert. The pears are heavy and often
drop before maturity, and the trees should not be set in wind-swept
situations. Despite these demerits of the fruits, the variety is well
worth planting in commercial orchards for late markets.

The original tree of Beurré Clairgeau appears to have grown by chance
about 1830 with Pierre Clairgeau, Nantes, France. M. Clairgeau's first
account of it was given in 1848 when he exhibited fruit. The reputation
of the variety seems to have been at once established, for J. de Jonghe
and others combined and purchased the stock of about 300 trees grafted
on quince. Together with the parent tree, these were the same year
removed to Brussels, and in 1852 the pear was placed on the market.
Thus it happened that a French pear was first distributed by Belgian
growers. The variety was introduced in America about 1854. The American
Pomological Society placed it upon its list of recommended fruits in
1860.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, unusually upright, dense, slow-growing,
 hardy, productive, a regular bearer; trunk slender, shaggy; branches
 smooth, slightly zigzag, ash-gray almost completely overspreading
 reddish-brown, with many lenticels; branchlets thick, short, with
 short internodes, greenish-brown, smooth, glabrous, with slightly
 raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds conical, pointed, appressed; leaves very numerous, 3 in.
 long, 2 in. wide, broadly oval, leathery; apex abruptly pointed;
 margin glandless, finely serrate; petiole 2 in. long, glabrous;
 stipules rudimentary or lacking. Flower-buds medium to long, conical,
 pointed; flowers 1-1/2 in. across, showy, in dense clusters, averaging
 7 buds to a cluster; pedicels 5/8 in. long, thick, pubescent, greenish.

 Fruit in season, late October and November; large, 3-5/8 in. long,
 2-5/8 in. wide, uniform in size, roundish-acute-pyriform, with a long,
 tapering neck, symmetrical, uniform in shape; stem 1/2 in. long,
 short, very thick and fleshy; cavity obtuse, very shallow and narrow,
 fleshy around the base of the stem, russeted, lipped; calyx open,
 large; lobes separated at the base, long, broad, acute or acuminate;
 basin shallow, narrow, obtuse, furrowed, often compressed; skin thick
 and granular, tough, smooth, glossy; color yellow, with bright red
 blush; dots many, small, russet, conspicuous; flesh white, quite
 granular, firm at first but becoming at maturity tender and melting,
 buttery, very juicy, sweet, aromatic, with a rich, vinous flavor;
 quality variable, good to best. Core large, closed, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds large, wide, long,
 plump, acute.

The catalogs and text-books supply Beurré Diel with several virtues
which Nature denies it as the variety grows in New York. As grown in
the eastern United States, the pears are dull and unattractive even
at maturity when the pale lemon color is brightest. When the tree is
happily situated as to soil and care, the quality of its product is
excellent, its fruits being delicious and ranking among the very best,
but when illy suited to soil, climate or care, the flesh is coarse, the
flavor insipid and astringent, bringing the quality down to second or
third rate. The pears keep and ship well. The tree is hardy, uncommonly
vigorous and fruitful, but very subject to blight; it is characterized
by its long twisting branches which need to be pruned back heavily. The
variety is still being planted, but there are better autumn pears.

This variety came from a chance seedling found near Brussels in 1805
by M. Meuris, head gardener for Dr. Van Mons. Being unnamed and of
fine quality, Van Mons dedicated it to his German friend, Diel, one of
the most distinguished German pomologists. Van Mons sent cions of the
variety to the London Horticultural Society in 1817. In 1823, Thomas
Andrew Knight sent cions to the Massachusetts Agricultural Society
whence it became disseminated generally throughout the United States.
The American Pomological Society placed this variety upon its fruit
catalog-list in 1854.

 Tree medium in size and vigor, spreading, open-topped, slow-growing,
 hardy, productive; trunk slender, smooth; branches slender, twisting,
 reddish-brown mingled with grayish scarf-skin, with few lenticels;
 branchlets with short internodes, dark reddish-brown, smooth,
 glabrous, with few small, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds obtuse, free; leaf-scars prominent. Leaves 2-3/4 in. long,
 1-3/4 in. wide, oval, thick, leathery; apex abruptly pointed; margin
 finely serrate; petiole 1-1/2 in. long. Flower-buds large, long,
 conical, rather plump, free; flowers open early, nearly 1-3/8 in.
 across, showy, in dense clusters, 7 or 8 buds in a cluster; pedicels
 1-1/8 in. long, pubescent, greenish.

 Fruit ripe in November; large, 3 in. long, 2-3/8 in. wide, uniform in
 size, obovate-obtuse-pyriform, often irregular and usually with sides
 unequal; stem 1-1/4 in. long, thick, curved; cavity obtuse, shallow,
 very narrow, russeted, furrowed and uneven, often lipped; calyx partly
 open, large; lobes separated at the base, broad, acute; basin shallow,
 obtuse, furrowed and uneven; skin very thick and granular, somewhat
 roughened by russet markings and by dots; color lemon-yellow, with

This is one of the few summer pears with a distinctly vinous flavor,
which, with the crisp and tender flesh, makes it one of the most
refreshing of summer fruits. The pears are larger than those of most
other sorts of its season, somewhat like those of Beurré Clairgeau in
shape and color, and ripen at a time--just before Clapp Favorite--when
good pears should be in demand for home and market. The fruits keep
well for summer pears, and are remarkable for their small cores. The
trees, while in no way remarkable, are quite up to the average in all
characters, and surpass most of their orchard associates in hardiness
and fruitfulness. The variety is desirable for both home and commercial
orchards.

This early summer pear was found as a chance seedling in 1825 by
Nicolas Giffard, Foussières, France. In 1840, M. Millet, president
of the Society of Horticulture of Maine-et-Loire, wrote the first
description of it in the Bulletins of the Society. It was introduced in
America about 1850, and in 1858 was added to the fruit catalog-list of
the American Pomological Society.

 Tree of medium size, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, hardy,
 productive; branches reddish-brown, nearly covered with gray
 scarf-skin, with long and narrow, large lenticels; branchlets slender,
 new growth willowy, long, reddish-brown, smooth, glabrous except near
 the tips of the new growth, with conspicuous, raised, round lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, pointed, appressed. Leaves 2-3/4 in. long,
 1-1/2 in. wide, stiff; apex taper-pointed; margin entire, sometimes
 slightly pubescent; petiole 2-1/2 in. long, slender, reddish-green;
 stipules very long and slender. Flower-buds small, plump, free,
 singly on very short spurs; flowers showy, 1-1/4 in. across, in
 dense clusters, average 8 buds in a cluster; pedicels 3/4 in. long,
 pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in late August; variable in size, averages 3 in. long,
 2-3/8 in. wide, obovate-acute-pyriform; stem 3/4 in. long; cavity
 lacking, the flesh closing up symmetrically around the stem
 except when drawn up in a lip; calyx open, small; lobes separated
 at the base, narrow, accuminate; basin shallow, narrow, obtuse,
 almost smooth, symmetrical; skin thin, tender, smooth; color dull
 greenish-yellow, with a dotted, dull red blush, often without blush;
 dots numerous, small, greenish and russet, very conspicuous; flesh
 tinged with yellow, granular at the center, melting, very juicy,
 vinous, highly aromatic; quality very good. Core small, closed, with
 clasping core-lines; calyx-tube narrow, funnel-shaped; seeds plump,
 acute.

Beurré Hardy is one of the good autumn pears. Both fruit and tree
commend it. The fruits are usually large; are handsome in appearance;
and the flesh and flavor are exceptionally fine. Thus, the flesh,
while a little granular at the core, is melting, juicy, and richly
aromatic,--as truly luscious as in any other pear. Unfortunately the
fruits do not keep well, having a tendency to soften at the core as
maturity advances. When poorly grown or not properly ripened, the
pears are sometimes a little astringent, and there is always a smack
of astringency. The trees, while not large, are vigorous, hardy,
productive, and healthy except in being a little susceptible to blight.
This is a favorite pear with nurserymen to bud or graft on the quince,
Japanese pear stocks, or other stocks, since it makes a perfect union
with any of those in common use. The tree is one of the best dwarfs,
also, for its own crop. Wherever pears are grown, this is a good
dessert sort, and in many regions it is a valuable fruit for commerce.
Beurré Hardy does especially well in New York and in eastern United
States.

This is a French pear raised about 1820 by M. Bonnet, Boulogne-sur-Mer,
France. In 1830, it was acquired by M. Jean-Laurent Jamin, a nurseryman
near Paris, who named it in honor of M. Hardy, Director and Professor
of Arboriculture at the Garden of the Luxembourg. It was propagated,
made known, and distributed by M. Jamin between 1840 and 1845. The
American Pomological Society added Beurré Hardy to its list of
recommended fruits in 1862.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright, dense-topped, hardy,
 productive; trunk stocky; branches smooth, dull brown overspread with
 gray, marked more or less with scarf-skin, with very numerous large,
 elongated lenticels; branchlets thick, greenish-brown, glossy, smooth,
 glabrous, with numerous small, raised, conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds conical, pointed, plump, usually free; leaf-scars prominent.
 Leaves 2-1/2 in. long, 2 in. wide, stiff; apex abruptly pointed;
 margin tipped with small glands, finely serrate; petiole 1-1/2 in.
 long. Flower-buds small, short, conical, pointed, plump, free, singly
 or in small clusters on short spurs; flowers 1-1/4 in. across, well
 distributed, average 9 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1 in. long,
 pubescent, reddish-green.

 Fruit in season, late September and early October; large, 3 in. long,
 2-1/4 in. wide, uniform, obtuse-pyriform, with a rather long neck,
 symmetrical; stem 7/8 in. long, thick, slightly curved; cavity obtuse,
 very shallow and narrow, russeted, often uneven and gently furrowed,
 lipped; calyx large, open; lobes broad, acute; basin shallow, narrow,
 obtuse, gently furrowed; skin granular, tender, russet; color dull
 greenish-yellow, overspread with thin, brownish-russet, without blush;
 dots numerous, russet, small, very conspicuous; flesh granular,
 melting, buttery, very juicy, sweet, richly aromatic and somewhat
 vinous; quality very good to best. Core large, closed, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds large, wide, long,
 plump, acute.

A prime requisite in any pear of best quality is that there be no
disagreeable after-taste in the flesh. The fruits of almost none of
the winter pears meet this requirement. Almost all have more or less
astringency in the after-taste. But the fruits of this variety are
wholly free from this astringency and are, moreover, so sweet and rich
that they are nearly as delectable as those of Seckel, the standard of
excellence in quality. The pears ripen at Geneva in January and may
be kept for a month or six weeks at a season when there are few other
sweet, rich pears, the fruits of nearly all other pears of this season
being vinous and piquant. The trees are hardy and productive, but are
slow in coming in bearing, rather small, and not at all self-assertive
and must be coddled somewhat. They are reported by many to do better
on quince than on pear stocks. The variety is desirable only for the
amateur.

According to Mas, the French pomologist, M. de Jonghe mentioned this
pear in a pamphlet on new varieties published in 1865. It was described
in the _Magazine of Horticulture_ in 1857 as a new variety. In
_Gardener's Chronicle_, 1866, M. de Jonghe said that he saw this pear
first in 1852 at Uccle, Belgium. The seedling had been planted there
two years before.

 Tree medium in size and vigor, spreading, slow-growing, hardy, very
 productive; trunk slender, shaggy; branches reddish-brown overspread
 with thick scarf-skin; branchlets thick, curved, short, with very
 short internodes, smooth except for the raised, conspicuous lenticels.
 Leaf-buds small, short; leaf-scars with prominent shoulders. Leaves
 2-3/4 in. long, 1-1/2 in. wide, thick; apex abruptly pointed; margin
 glandular, finely serrate; petiole 1-1/2 in. long, reddish-green.
 Flower-buds large, long, very plump, free; flowers 1-1/4 in. across, 7
 or 8 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1/2 in. long, thick.

 Fruit ripe December to January; medium in size, 3 in. long, 2-1/4
 in. wide, obovate-obtuse-pyriform, very regular; stem short, thick,
 inserted obliquely; cavity very shallow or none, the flesh often
 drawn up in a lip on one side of the stem; calyx small, open; basin
 shallow; skin thin; color dull yellow, thickly overspread with a
 pale, brownish-russet, often with traces of a russet-red blush; dots
 numerous, small, dull russet; flesh nearly white, fine-grained,
 melting, buttery, pleasant flavored, aromatic, sweet; quality very
 good.

Tender in skin and delicate in flesh, the product of this variety is
not for the markets, but that of few other sorts so admirably supplies
those who want choicely good fruits. The pears are not as attractive
in appearance as might be wished, but are hardly surpassed in flavor in
their season. The flesh is notable for juiciness, rich vinous flavor,
and pleasant perfume. The trees are large, healthy even as regards
blight, very productive, and are easily suited as to soils. The trees
do not bear early, but are regular in bearing after this life event
begins. In Europe, the variety is commonly and successfully grown as a
dwarf, and the pear-growers of a generation ago in America recommend
this variety as one of the good sorts to work on the quince. The
variety is a valuable one for home orchards, especially in New York
where it grows exceptionally well.

Beurré Superfin was raised from a bed of pear seeds made at Angers,
France, by M. Goubault, a well-known pomologist, in 1837. The
parent tree so produced bore fruit in 1844 and the Committee of the
Horticultural Society of Maine-et-Loire was requested to report on its
merits, which it did in that year, and M. Millet, president of the
society, named it Beurré Superfin. It was introduced in America about
1850. The variety was placed on the fruit catalog-list of the American
Pomological Society in 1858.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped, hardy, very
 productive; trunk stocky, rough; branches thick, rough and shaggy,
 zigzag, dull brownish-red, overspread with gray scarf-skin, sprinkled
 with numerous elongated lenticels; branchlets slender, light brown,
 glossy, smooth, glabrous, with small, raised, inconspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, conical, pointed, plump, appressed or free;
 leaf-scars prominent. Leaves 3-1/4 in. long, 1-7/8 in. wide, stiff;
 apex abruptly pointed; margin tipped with small glands, coarsely
 serrate; petiole 1-3/4 in. long. Flower-buds conical, pointed, plump,
 free, singly on short branches and short spurs.

 Fruit matures in October; large, 3-1/4 in. long, 2-3/4 in. wide,
 roundish-oblate, with a short, thick, rounded neck, symmetrical; stem
 1-1/8 in. long, very thick, curved; cavity very shallow and narrow or
 lacking, the flesh tapering into the stem or wrinkled in a fleshy fold
 about the base of the stem, often lipped; calyx open; lobes separated
 at the base, broad, narrow; basin narrow, obtuse, gently furrowed,
 symmetrical; skin very granular, tender, smooth; color yellow, netted
 and streaked with light russet, often with a slight brownish-russet
 cheek; dots numerous, small, russet, conspicuous; flesh tinged with
 yellow, granular, melting, buttery, very juicy, sweet yet with a rich,
 brisk, vinous flavor, aromatic; quality very good. Core large, closed,
 with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds
 large, wide, long, plump, acute.

 _Bloodgood's Sommerbirne._ =9.= Mathieu _Nom. Pom._ 186. 1889.

Bloodgood has long been a standard summer pear in America. It
surpasses any European associate of its season in both fruit- and
tree-characters. In particular, the fruits are meritorious for flesh
of fine texture, which, though a little granular, is melting and
juicy, and has a rich, sweet, perfumed flavor. Complaints appear in
the horticultural press that the quality is exceedingly variable.
The reports of poor flavor may arise from the fact that the quality
is always poor if the fruit is not picked as soon as full grown and
ripened indoors. The season in New York is August. The trees are
resistant to blight, healthy, bear young and regularly, are long-lived,
and attain large size, although in some situations they are but medium
in size. The variety has little or no value in commercial plantations,
but is prized in every collection for home use.

The origin of this pear is unknown, but it is supposed to be a native
of New York. It seems to have been brought to notice about 1835 by
James Bloodgood of the nursery firm of Bloodgood and Company, Flushing,
Long Island. According to Robert Manning, the variety was listed in
Prince's _Catalogue_ for 1837 as Early Beurré. After being introduced
by Bloodgood and Company, it was speedily recognized as one of the
most valuable native sorts. The variety was placed upon the fruit
catalog-list of the American Pomological Society in 1848.

 Tree medium in size and vigor, upright, dense, slow-growing,
 productive; trunk medium in thickness and smoothness; branches
 zigzag, reddish-brown partly overspread with grayish scarf-skin,
 marked with few small lenticels; branchlets thick, very long, with
 long internodes, reddish-brown, the new growth greenish, with a brown
 tinge, glossy, smooth, with small, raised, conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds broad at the base, small, short, sharply pointed, free;
 leaf-scars with prominent shoulders. Leaves 2-1/4 in. long, 1-3/8
 in. wide, oval, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin finely serrate;
 petiole 1-1/4 in. long, slender, tinged red; stipules few, variable
 in size and shape, tinged red. Flower-buds medium in size and length,
 conical, plump, free, arranged singly on short spurs; flowers early,
 1-1/4 in. across, in dense clusters, 7 or 8 buds in a cluster;
 pedicels often 7/8 in. long, pubescent.

 Fruit matures in late August; medium in size, 2-1/8 in. long, 2 in.
 wide, roundish-pyriform to acute-pyriform, symmetrical, uniform,
 with equal sides; stem 3/4 in. long, thick; cavity russeted, lipped,
 drawn up in fleshy folds about the stem; calyx open, small; lobes
 separated at the base, short, broad, obtuse; basin narrow, obtuse,
 smooth, symmetrical; skin thick, tough, roughish; color bright yellow,
 with patches and nettings of russet, producing a mottled russet
 effect; dots many, small, russet, inconspicuous; flesh tinged yellow,
 granular, melting, buttery, rich, very juicy, sweet, highly flavored,
 aromatic; quality very good. Core small, closed, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube short, narrow, conical; seeds small, short,
 plump, acute.

Were it not that Tyson is better in both tree and fruit, Brandywine,
which ripens its crop with that of Tyson, could be put down as about
the best pear of its season. Tyson is the better variety, however,
in almost every soil and situation, and Brandywine has a place in
American pear flora only because the pears have a distinct flavor which
gives them the charm of individuality. The flesh is neither sweet nor
perfumed, as is that of most pears at this season, but has the piquant
smack of some of the winter pears which makes the fruits particularly
refreshing. The tree is vigorous, with a handsome pyramidal top, but is
not remarkable otherwise. Sometimes it is unproductive. The variety is
worth planting for the sake of diversity in home orchards.

The original tree, a chance seedling, was found on the farm of Eli
Harvey, Chaddsford, on the banks of the Brandywine River, Pennsylvania.
This parent tree began to bear about 1820, but in 1835 wind broke it
down near the surface of the ground. The present tree is a sucker
from the original, and first fruited in 1844. This fact accounts for
its not sooner having become known to cultivation. Dr. Brincklé of
Philadelphia showed the fruits first at a meeting of the Massachusetts
Horticultural Society in 1848 when it received high commendations. In
1858 the American Pomological Society added Brandywine to its list of
recommended fruits.

 Tree large, vigorous, very upright, dense-topped, productive; branches
 long, olive-gray, sprinkled with roundish lenticels; branchlets
 slender, curved, with short internodes, brownish-red overspread with
 scarf-skin, glabrous, with few small, obscure lenticels.

 Leaf-buds medium in size and length, pointed, free. Leaves small,
 long-ovate; apex taper-pointed; margin serrate; petiole 1-1/2 in.
 long. Flower-buds large, plump, conical, free, singly on spurs and as
 terminal buds; flowers 7/8 in. across, in dense clusters, average 9
 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1/2 in. long, slender, pubescent.

 Fruit ripens in late August and early September; medium in size,
 2-3/4 in. long, 2-1/2 in. wide, variable in shape but generally
 obovate-pyriform; stem 1-1/2 in. long, fleshy, curved, obliquely
 attached; cavity lacking, the flesh drawn up in a wrinkled fold about
 the base of the stem; calyx large, open; lobes short, entire; basin
 small, shallow, usually smooth; skin roughish; color greenish-yellow,
 blushed with red on the sunny side, marked with tracings of russet
 especially near the cavity; dots numerous, large, conspicuous, russet;
 flesh whitish, or faintly tinged with yellow, granular, melting,
 juicy, aromatic, vinous; quality good to very good. Core small; seeds
 few, small, dark brown.

Without deserving a high place among pears, Buffum has several
meritorious characters which should keep it in the list of standard
varieties. The variety must depend chiefly on its tree-characters
for approbation, and in these it excels nearly all of its orchard
associates. The trees are remarkably vigorous, nearly free from blight,
very productive, although they have a tendency to bear biennially;
and by virtue of great size, symmetrical, pyramidal form, dark green,
glossy foliage, and sturdy, ruddy wood in winter, they are among the
most ornamental of all fruit trees. In full leaf, a Buffum tree might
easily be taken for a Lombardy poplar. The quality of the fruits is
very variable. At times the flesh is rich, aromatic, melting, and very
good; again, the pears may be insipid or even illy flavored, devoid of
perfume, coarse in texture, and poor. The fruits are never large and
often run small. To attain good quality, the pears must be picked early
and ripened in a moderately cool fruit-room. The culture of Buffum is
on the wane, chiefly for the reason that its fruits ripen with those of
Seckel and fail in competition, as the Seckels are nearly as large and
much better in quality. But because of its admirable tree-characters
the variety should not be lost.

Some confusion exists as to the origin of Buffum. Some writers state
that the original tree stood on the grounds of Prescott Hall, Newport,
Rhode Island. Hovey, however, in his _Fruits of America_, 1851, says
that the variety originated in the garden of David Buffum, Warren,
Rhode Island, shortly after the advent of the nineteenth century. In
the opinion of Downing the variety came from seed of White Doyenné.
Soon after the founding of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society
in 1828, Robert Manning exhibited specimens of the Buffum pear, and
through him the variety became known in the vicinity of Boston from
which place it was disseminated throughout the country. Buffum was
added to the fruit-list of the American Pomological Society in 1852.

 Tree vigorous, very upright, dense, hardy, almost immune to blight,
 very productive; branches shaggy, zigzag, reddish-brown, overspread
 with grayish scarf-skin, with numerous small lenticels; branchlets
 short, reddish-brown, tinged with green and streaked with grayish
 scarf-skin, smooth, glabrous, with conspicuous, small, raised
 lenticels.

 prominent. Leaves 3-1/4 in. long, 2 in. wide, oval, thin, leathery;
 apex abruptly pointed; margin glandular, finely serrate; petiole 2-1/4
 in. long. Flower-buds large, conical, pointed, plump, free, arranged
 singly on short spurs and branchlets; flowers 1-1/2 in. across, showy,

Clapp Favorite is by universal consent the standard late summer pear to
precede Bartlett, which it much resembles in size, shape, color, and
flavor. In most regions in the United States and Canada where pears
are largely grown for the market, Clapp Favorite is the first pear
to be put on the market. The season is usually a week or sometimes
ten days before that of Bartlett. The chief fault of the fruits is
that they soon soften at the center after ripening, to obviate which
they should be picked at least ten days before they would ripen on
the tree. This softening at the core debars the fruit from distant
markets, and makes it suitable only for local trade. The illustration
of the whole fruit in the accompanying plate is so foreshortened by the
camera that size and shape are not shown correctly, but the half-fruit
illustrates the size and shape very well. The fruits are usually a
little larger than those of Bartlett. Except in one particular, the
trees of Clapp Favorite are as nearly perfect as those of any variety
in American orchards. The weak character, unfortunately, is a most
important one, and all but debars the variety from some regions in
which pear-growing is a large industry. The weakness is susceptibility
to blight. No standard pear goes down so quickly as this one when
blight is epidemic. Two good characters of the trees redeem the variety
from failure because of blight. After those of Flemish Beauty and
Tyson, the trees of this variety show greater hardihood to cold than
those of any other standard sort; and of all pears grown in America,
Kieffer not excepted, the trees of Clapp Favorite are most fruitful.
Other merits of the tree are large size, great vigor, longevity, and
earliness and regularity in bearing. The variety shows a predilection
for heavy soils, and the trees may be set on the heaviest clays. Clapp
Favorite is grown satisfactorily on dwarf as well as standard stocks.
The variety is a desirable one wherever pears are grown, and is one of
the half-dozen leading sorts in New York.

Clapp Favorite was raised by Thaddeus Clapp, Dorchester, Massachusetts,
but the date of its origin is uncertain. It was favorably mentioned as
a promising new fruit at the meeting of the Massachusetts Horticultural
Society in 1860. By some writers this pear is supposed to be a cross
between Flemish Beauty and Bartlett, but this supposition cannot be
proved. The variety was early introduced into England and France where
it almost immediately received favorable commendation. The American
Pomological Society first listed Clapp Favorite in its fruit-catalog in
1867.

Colonel Wilder originated in California and was once a favorite
there, but is now reported as being little planted. At one time it
was prominent in eastern orchards because of its late season and
large, handsome, well-flavored fruits. The variety came in competition
with Beurré d'Anjou, however, the season and fruits of the two being
similar, but the trees of Colonel Wilder were so greatly outmatched by
those of Beurré d'Anjou that this variety is less and less planted in
the East. Perhaps it is worth preserving in pear collections for the
sake of variety.

This pear originated from seed sown by Bernard S. Fox, San Jose,
California, about 1870. It was named after Marshall P. Wilder, Boston,
Massachusetts. Just prior to his death Mr. Fox, in a letter to the
editor of the _Rural Press_, wrote of three pears, P. Barry, Fox, and
Colonel Wilder, as follows: "The list of pears is already large, and,
unless something extremely good is offered, there is no use adding to
it. But, after many years of trial here and elsewhere, I claim now,
that, at their respective times of ripening, there are no large pears
superior to them in size, flavor, and good shipping qualities."

 Tree medium in size, spreading and drooping, open-topped, hardy,
 an uncertain bearer; trunk shaggy; branches stocky, roughish,
 reddish-brown nearly covered with gray scarf-skin, marked with many
 lenticels; branchlets slender, willowy, light brown, with a slight
 reddish tinge, smooth, glabrous, with few small, slightly raised,
 obscure lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, sharply pointed, free or slightly appressed.
 Leaves 2-1/4 in. long, 1-1/4 in. wide, narrow, short, oval, leathery;
 apex abruptly pointed; margin glandless, finely serrate; petiole 2-1/4
 in. long, slender, pale green or yellowish, sometimes with a tinge of
 pink; stipules light greenish-yellow, with a pink tinge. Flower-buds
 small, short, conical, plump, free, arranged singly on very short
 spurs; blossoms open very late; flowers 1-1/4 in. across, in dense
 clusters, 7 or 8 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1/2 in. long, pubescent,
 greenish.

 Fruit in season, late December to February; large, 3 in. long, 2-1/4
 in. wide, uniform in size, ribbed, oblong-obovate-pyriform, with
 unequal sides; stem 3/4 in. long, thick, curved; cavity small, obtuse,
 shallow, narrow, furrowed, occasionally lipped; calyx large, open;
 lobes separated at the base, narrow, acute; basin shallow, narrow,
 abrupt, usually smooth, symmetrical; skin thick, tough, rough, dull;
 color light yellow, often with a faint orange-red blush on the exposed
 cheek, with nettings and markings of russet; dots numerous, small,
 grayish and russet-colored, conspicuous; flesh yellowish-white,
 granular around the core, melting, buttery, very juicy, sweet,
 aromatic, with a musky flavor; quality good. Core large, closed, with
 clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds wide,
 plump, acute.

Once a favorite in eastern United States, Columbia is planted now only
in collections. The variety never was a leader as far north as the pear
regions of New York and Massachusetts, but when pear-growing was being
attempted in the southern states in the middle of the last century,
before the advent of Kieffer, Garber, and Le Conte, Columbia was the
most dependable sort for the South. The pears are not attractive
in appearance, nor remarkably good in quality, but the trees are
vigorous, healthy, and very fruitful, although they come in bearing
late. The variety is above the average in both fruit and tree, and is
too valuable to be discarded. This variety must not be confused with
the Columbia now listed in many catalogs, the proper name of which is
Barseck.

The original seedling grew on the farm of a Mr. Casser in Westchester
County, thirteen miles from New York City. In 1835, Bloodgood and
Company, nurserymen of Flushing, Long Island, secured fruit from the
original tree, which was then fifteen inches in diameter, and sent it
to the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. Later, the variety was
propagated and distributed by the Bloodgood Nursery. Columbia was added
to the fruit-catalog of the American Pomological Society in 1862.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, very productive; trunk
 stocky, roughish; branches thick, rough, shaggy, dull brownish-red
 overspread with much gray scarf-skin, marked with roundish lenticels;
 branchlets short, light brown intermingled with green, dull, smooth,
 glabrous, with few very small, slightly raised, lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, conical, pointed, plump, usually appressed.
 Leaves 3-1/4 in. long, 1-1/2 in. wide, long-oval, thin; apex abruptly
 pointed; margin finely serrate, usually tipped with very small glands;
 petiole 2-1/4 in. long. Flower-buds small, short, conical, pointed,
 plump, free, arranged singly on short spurs; blossoms late; flowers
 1-3/4 in. across, very showy, in dense clusters, 9 to 12 buds in a
 cluster; pedicels 1-1/8 in. long, very thick, pubescent, light green.

 Fruit ripe from late November to January; large, 3 in. long, 2-3/8 in.
 wide, uniform in size, oblong-obovate-pyriform, broad at the middle,
 unequal sides, uniform in general shape; stem 1 in. long, curved,
 thick; cavity obtuse, very shallow and narrow, smooth; calyx partly
 open, large; lobes narrow, acuminate; basin shallow, obtuse, wrinkled;
 skin thick, granular, tough, roughish, dull; color yellowish-green,
 frequently with a dotted, dull red blush on the exposed cheek; dots
 many, of various colors, conspicuous; flesh yellowish-white, firm,
 granular, rather tough, very juicy, sweet, aromatic and rich; quality
 good. Core large, closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube wide,
 conical; seeds narrow, very long, often flattened and abortive,
 acuminate.

Dana Hovey is a delicious little dessert pear, so juicy, sweet, and
rich that it is a veritable sweetmeat. The fruits are so similar to
those of Seckel that the variety is sometimes called "Winter Seckel."
Dana Hovey is one of the best pears to succeed Seckel. The fruits come
in season about the middle of November and keep six weeks in ordinary
storage. The flavor is that of Winter Nelis with a smack of Seckel. If
the fruits are picked early and kept in a dry, cool place they ripen
early in December with a rich, golden color strewn with russet. It is
in the same class with Seckel as to size of fruit, although the pears
average larger and are more uniform in size from different trees and
in different seasons. The pears are also more brightly colored than
those of Seckel. Superiority in size and color makes the fruits of this
variety much more attractive than those of the better-known Seckel.
The trees are hardy, vigorous, and thrive on various soils but are
only moderately productive and are somewhat susceptible to blight,
falling far short of those of Seckel in these characters, for which
reason the last-named variety is the better for commercial plantations.
Dana Hovey is one of few winter pears with fruits of high quality, and
thus is very desirable for home plantations and ought to have value in
commercial plantations.

Francis Dana, Roxbury, Massachusetts, was an indefatigable raiser of
new fruits, there being no fewer than sixteen varieties of pears with
the prefix "Dana's," of which the one under notice is the best of all.
It was introduced to the public about 1854 under the name of Dana's
Hovey in honor of C. M. Hovey, the well-known nurseryman of Boston and
author of _The Fruits of America_. Dana Hovey is so similar to Seckel
that the latter is supposed to be one of its parents. The variety was
added to the American Pomological Society's fruit-list in 1862.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, rapid-growing, productive;
 trunk stocky; branches reddish-brown mingled with green which is
 almost completely overspread with gray scarf-skin, marked by few
 small lenticels; branchlets thick, short, light brown mingled with
 green, marked with ash-gray at the tips, smooth, glabrous, with small,
 scattering, slightly raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, pointed, plump, usually appressed. Leaves
 3-1/4 in. long, 2-1/8 in. wide, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin
 glandless or with few reddish glands, finely serrate; petiole short,
 stocky, 1-1/2 in. long, glabrous. Flower-buds short, conical but
 obtuse at the apex, plump, free, arranged singly on short spurs;
 flowers 1-1/2 in. across, in dense clusters, average 8 buds in a
 cluster; pedicels 3/4 in. long, slender, thinly pubescent.

 Fruit matures in late October and November; medium in size, 2-1/2
 in. long, 2-1/8 in. wide, obovate-obtuse-pyriform, symmetrical,
 uniform; stem 1/2 in. long, slender; cavity abrupt, shallow, very
 small, narrow, slightly lipped; calyx partly open, small; lobes short,
 narrow, acute; basin shallow, narrow, obtuse, smooth, symmetrical;
 skin thin, tender, smooth; color golden-yellow at maturity, covered
 with thin russet; dots numerous, small, greenish-russet; flesh tinged
 with yellow, granular at the center, tender and melting, juicy, sweet,
 highly perfumed; quality of the best. Core large, closed, abaxile;
 calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds wide, short, plump, obtuse.

Once a favorite, Dearborn is now nearly lost to cultivation, and few
or no nurserymen grow the trees. It is too good a variety to be lost,
however, because of splendid fruit- and tree-characters. The fruits
ripen early and are of good quality, though hardly as richly flavored
as those of Elizabeth which ripen at the same time. Unfortunately the
pears run small, but they are attractive in shape and color. In season,
the crop succeeds that of Bloodgood and precedes that of Bartlett.
The trees are almost flawless, and therefore are well adapted to home
orchards where fruits cannot receive the care of skilled hands. Besides
being almost free from blight, the trees are hardy, vigorous, and very
productive. The variety has many valuable qualities for a summer pear
in home orchards.

This pear was found growing in a border of shrubs in 1818 at
Brinley Place, Roxbury, Massachusetts, the home of General H. A. S.
Dearborn,[27] first president of the Massachusetts Horticultural
Society. In 1831, General Dearborn first exhibited fruit of the
variety at the Massachusetts Horticultural Society where it was named
Dearborn's Seedling in honor of the originator. This variety should
not be confused with a pear raised by Van Mons of Belgium and named by
him Dearborn. The Dearborn of Van Mons is larger and ripens later than
the American Dearborn, and was long since taken from lists of pears
recommended for cultivation in America. Dearborn was included in the
American Pomological Society's first fruit-catalog in 1848, where it
was called Dearborn's Seedling. In 1883, the Society shortened the name
to Dearborn. Since 1891, the name has failed to appear in the catalogs
of this Society.

 Tree large, vigorous, spreading, tall, very productive; trunk stocky;
 branches thick, zigzag, reddish-brown partly covered with a heavy,
 gray scarf-skin, marked by many reddish-brown lenticels; branchlets
 slender, very long, with long internodes, older wood brown, new growth
 greenish, nearly covered with reddish-brown, mottled with ash-gray
 scarf-skin, smooth, glabrous becoming pubescent near the tips of the
 new growth, with numerous small, brownish, round, raised, conspicuous
 lenticels.

 Leaf-buds very small, short, pointed, plump, free. Leaves 3 in. long,
 1-1/2 in. wide, thin; apex obtusely-pointed; margin with very fine
 dark tips, finely and shallowly serrate; petiole tinged red, 1-3/4
 in. long, glabrous. Flower-buds small, short, conical, plump, free,
 arranged singly on short spurs; flowers showy, 1-1/4 in. across, in
 dense clusters, 9 or 10 buds in a cluster; pedicels 3/4 in. long,
 pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in late August; small, 2 in. long, 2-1/4 in. wide, uniform,
 roundish-pyriform, with a slight neck, symmetrical, uniform; stem 1
 in. long, slender; cavity obtuse, shallow, narrow, thinly russeted,
 often slightly lipped; calyx open, large; lobes separated at the
 base, narrow, acuminate; basin very shallow, obtuse, gently furrowed
 and wrinkled, symmetrical; skin thick, very tough, smooth, dull;
 color pale yellow, with russet specks; dots numerous, small, russet,
 conspicuous; flesh white, slightly granular at the center, tender and
 melting, very juicy, sweet but spicy, aromatic; quality good. Core
 large for the size of the fruit, closed, with clasping core-lines;
 calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds large, wide, long, plump, acute.

Dorset has been on probation in New York for twenty-five years, and
its status is not yet decided. The fruits resemble those of Seckel
in shape and color, but are larger and come in season later. These
external resemblances to Seckel have given it the name "Late Seckel,"
which, however, is a misnomer, as a taste of the two fruits at once
makes plain. Dorset is not nearly as richly flavored as Seckel. The
tree-characters are all very good. Since there are few good late pears
to follow Seckel, there may be a place for Dorset.

Dorset was raised from seed by Lemuel Clapp, Dorchester, Massachusetts,
but the exact date of origin is unknown. The variety was introduced
by Ellwanger and Barry, Rochester, New York, in 1895. During the next
ten years it was placed on trial by several state experiment stations,
and soon gained a reputation for the characters noted in the preceding
paragraph.

 Tree small, spreading, very productive, a regular bearer; trunk
 slender, shaggy; branches slender, smooth, reddish-brown mingled with
 dull ash-gray, marked with many large lenticels; branchlets slender,
 dark brown, smooth, glabrous, with large, raised, lenticels.

 Leaf-buds medium to small, conical, pointed, free. Leaves 3 in. long,
 1-1/2 in. wide, oval, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin crenate;
 petiole 1-3/4 in. long, slender. Flower-buds large, long, conical,
 pointed, free; blossoms open very early; flowers often 1-3/8 in.
 across, showy, in dense clusters, from 8 to 12 buds in a cluster;
 pedicels 1 in. or less in length, pubescent, greenish.

 Fruit matures in December; medium in size, 2-3/4 in. long, 2-1/2
 in. wide, uniform in size and shape, obovate-obtuse-pyriform, with
 unequal sides; stem 3/4 in. long, curved, cavity almost lacking,
 obtuse, shallow, narrow, furrowed, compressed, often lipped; calyx
 open; lobes separated at the base, long, acute; basin narrow, obtuse
 or often quite abrupt, gently furrowed; skin thick, smooth; color dull
 greenish-yellow, marked with a dull bronze-red blush on the exposed
 cheek; dots many, small, grayish and russet, conspicuous; flesh
 yellowish-white, firm, granular at the center, tender, very juicy,
 very sweet and aromatic; quality good. Core closed, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds large, wide, long,
 plump, acute, broad at the base.

In regions where blight and heat make pear-growing precarious, and
only pears with oriental blood, as Kieffer, Garber, and Le Conte, can
be grown, Douglas, which belongs with the pears just named, might well
be tried. Certainly it is better in flavor than any other variety of
its class. The trees come in bearing remarkably early, and are as
productive as those of Kieffer, though hardly as large or as vigorous.
The trees are inclined to overbear, in which case the fruits run small.
The variety has little to recommend it for New York, but those who grow
Kieffer might put it on probation with the hope of growing a fruit
passably fair for dessert.

Douglas is a seedling of Kieffer crossed, it is believed, with Duchesse
d'Angoulême by O. H. Ayer, Lawrence, Douglas County, Kansas, about the
year 1897. It fruited first in 1902 and attracted the attention of A.
H. Griesa, also of Lawrence, who propagated it in 1907, and sent out
specimens of it for appraisement in October, 1910, when it was very
favorably reported on by many prominent horticulturists. In accordance
with Mr. Griesa's suggestion, it was named Douglas after the county of
its origin.

 Tree medium in size and vigor, upright, very productive; trunk
 slender, smooth; branches slender, dull brownish-red, mottled with
 gray scarf-skin; branchlets medium in thickness and length, smooth,
 glabrous, sprinkled with numerous raised, conspicuous lenticels.
 Leaf-buds large, long, pointed, plump, free; leaf-scars prominent.
 Leaves 3-1/4 in. long, 1-1/2 in. wide, thick; apex taper-pointed;
 margin glandless, finely and shallowly serrate; petiole 1-5/8 in.
 long. Flower-buds large, long, conical, plump, free; flowers 1-1/4 in.
 across, white or occasionally with a faint tinge of pink, 11 or 12
 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1-5/8 in. long.

 Fruit matures in October; large, 3-1/4 in. long, 2-3/4 in. wide,
 obovate-pyriform, tapering at both ends like the Kieffer; stem 1-5/8
 in. long, slender; cavity deep, narrow, compressed, often lipped;
 calyx small, partly open; basin furrowed; skin thick, tough; color
 pale yellow, heavily dotted and sometimes flecked with russet; dots
 numerous, small, light russet or greenish; flesh tinged with yellow,
 firm but tender, granular, very juicy, sweet yet with an invigorating
 flavor; quality good. Core closed, axile; calyx-tube short, wide;
 seeds long, plump, acute.

This old French pear is worth planting, if the trees can be obtained,
because of its very late fruits and long season. The pears come in
season under ordinary conditions in December and keep until March.
The fruits are not remarkable for either taste or appearance, but are
good for a winter product when there is little competition with other
varieties. The pears are admirably adapted for culinary purposes. In
some seasons the pears fail to ripen, and the variety should be planted
only on warm soils and in situations where the season is warm and long.
Tree and fruit have a family resemblance to Easter Beurré; the latter,
however, is generally a better pear than this one. This variety is
much grown in Europe on the quince, and in the various fanciful forms
Europeans make use of in training fruit trees.

Doyenné d'Alençon is reported to be a wilding discovered by the Abbé
Malassis near Alençon, Orne, France, and propagated by M. Thuillier,
a nurseryman at Alençon. There was, however, a pear of the same name
and season found at Orléans in 1628, in the orchard of Le Lectier, the
renowned pomologist. It is probable that the pear which M. Thuillier
propagated was the one found many years previously by Le Lectier. The
variety must have been introduced into America between 1840 and 1850,
as it was mentioned by the American Pomological Society in 1856 as one
of the promising new pears. In 1858, the Society added the variety to
its fruit-catalog, but discontinued recommending it in 1897.

 Tree medium in size and vigor, upright, dense-topped, productive;
 trunk thick, shaggy; branches stocky, reddish-brown lightly covered
 with gray scarf-skin; branchlets slender, curved, short, with short
 internodes, light brown, with a faint reddish tinge, smooth, pubescent
 near the tips of the new growth, with numerous small, raised,
 conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, sharply pointed, plump, free; leaf-scars with
 prominent shoulders. Leaves 2-3/4 in. long, 1-1/8 in. wide, thin;
 apex taper-pointed; margin with few glands, coarsely serrate; petiole
 2-5/8 in. long, glabrous, with tinge of red, slender. Flower-buds
 small, short, conical, plump, free, arranged singly on short spurs;
 flowers early, 1-1/4 in. across, in dense clusters, average 9 buds in
 a cluster; pedicels 5/8 in. long, lightly pubescent.

 Fruit ripe December to February; 2-7/8 in. long, 2-3/8 in. wide,

This old Belgian pear is a leader in the second rank of commercial
pears in this country. If the fruits were better in quality and kept a
little longer, the variety would take rank among the best commercial
pears, for the fruits are handsome and the trees are nearly flawless.
As the color-plate shows, there are few pears more attractive than
this one, but the briskly acid flavor is not pleasing to many, and the
fruits become soft at the center soon after ripening. The pears are
above medium in size and are sometimes large or very large. The seeds
are often abortive. The trees are very large and vigorous, as hardy as
those of any other pear to cold, less susceptible to blight than most
of their orchard associates, and are remarkable for their prominent
buds and large, thick, glossy-green leaves, which turn deep red in the
autumn. On some soils the trees do not hold their crop well, and it
is always best to plant them where there is some protection against
heavy winds. The trees are prodigious bearers, and fruit regularly,
characters which make the variety desirable for local markets.

This pear is supposed to have been raised by Van Mons at the beginning
of the nineteenth century. It was placed on sale at Brussels about
1819. The variety was first given the name Doyenné de Mérode in honor
of the Comté de Mérode of Waterloo, Belgium. In 1836, however, the
name was changed to Doyenné Boussock. The catalog of the Horticultural
Society of London shows that it was received in England in 1842.
William Kenrick, on his return from Europe in the spring of 1841,
brought the variety to America. In 1856 the American Pomological
Society added this pear to its fruit-list.

 Tree very large, vigorous, upright-spreading, tall, hardy, productive;
 trunk thick, shaggy; branches stocky, shaggy, grayish-brown;
 branchlets long, with long internodes, light brown tinged with red,
 overspread with ash-gray, smooth, glabrous, with few elongated,
 raised, inconspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, sharply pointed, plump, free; leaf-scars with
 prominent shoulders. Leaves 3-1/2 in. long, 1-7/8 in. wide,
 leathery; apex abruptly pointed; margin very finely serrate; petiole
 1-1/2 in. long, slender. Flower-buds small, long and narrow, conical,
 free, singly on very short spurs; flowers early, showy, 1-5/8 in.
 across, in dense clusters, average 8 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1-1/8
 in. long, thick, pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in September; large, 3 in. long, 2-3/4 in. wide, uniform,
 obtuse-obovate-pyriform, symmetrical; stem 1 in. long, very thick;
 cavity obtuse, rather shallow, broad, often russeted, furrowed,
 lipped; calyx large, open; lobes separated at the base, broad,
 acute; basin shallow, wide, obtuse, gently furrowed and wrinkled;
 skin thin, tender, smooth except for the russet nettings; color pale
 yellow, occasionally with a mottled pinkish-red blush on the exposed
 cheek, more or less netted with russet; dots numerous, small, russet,
 conspicuous; flesh white, tender and melting, buttery, very juicy,
 briskly acid; quality good. Core large, closed, axile, with meeting
 core-lines; calyx-tube very short, wide, broadly conical; seeds black,
 narrow, long, flattened, often abortive.

This pear has been esteemed long and justly for the beauty and high
quality of its fruits. If its tree-characters were better the variety
would take high place in commercial orcharding as well as for the
home orchard, to which it is now almost wholly confined. The fruits
are very large, smooth except for russet markings, clear handsome
yellow at maturity, sometimes brightened by a delicate blush, with
yellow, fine-grained flesh which is tender, melting, very juicy, sweet,
piquant, perfumed. The quality is so good that the fruits of this
variety are called by many the best of all pears. The list of faults
for the trees is as long as the list of merits for the fruits. The
young trees make a poor growth in the nursery; young or old, the trees
must be humored in soil, climate, and care; they are subject to blight;
while usually productive, they are not always so even where vigorous,
healthy, and hardy; lastly, they are a little below the average in
hardihood to cold. The variety is seldom at home in New York, but where
it thrives, as on the Pacific slope, it is a valuable commercial pear,
and is always worthy a place in the home orchard or in the collection
of the pear-fancier. In Europe, it is reported as doing especially well
on the quince.

The parent tree of Doyenné du Comice was taken from the first seed bed
made in the fruit-garden of the Comice Horticole, Angers, Department
of Maine-et-Loire, France. In November, 1849, it produced its first
fruit, which was at once so highly esteemed that it was named Doyenné
du Comice. It was placed on the market with unusual promptitude and
rapidly distributed in foreign lands, reaching America about 1850.
The variety was recommended for general cultivation by the American
Pomological Society in 1862.

 Tree vigorous, characteristically upright, dense, usually productive;
 branches smooth, dull gray mingled with greenish-brown, marked with
 large lenticels; branchlets long, brown tinged with red, glabrous,
 with many small, slightly raised, conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds large, medium to long, conical, pointed, nearly free;
 leaf-scars prominent. Leaves 3-1/4 in. long, 1-1/2 in. wide, oval,
 leathery; margin finely serrate; petiole 2 in. long. Flower-buds
 short, conical, free; blossoms open late; flowers 1-1/4 in. across,
 in dense clusters, about 8 buds in a cluster; pedicels 7/8 in. long,
 slender, pubescent, light green.

 Fruit ripe in late October and November; large, 3 in. long, 2-3/4 in.
 wide, obovate-obtuse-pyriform or roundish, with unequal sides; stem
 1-1/4 in. long, very thick, usually curved; cavity obtuse, shallow,
 narrow, russeted and wrinkled, often with a fleshy ring around the
 base of the stem; calyx open; lobes separated at the base, long,
 narrow, acuminate; basin medium to wide, obtuse, often furrowed; skin
 tough and granular, smooth except for the russet markings, dull; color
 clear yellow, often with a very faint russet-red blush on the exposed
 cheek, the surface heavily covered with large patches and nettings
 of attractive russet; dots many, very small, dark brown, obscure;
 flesh tinged strongly with yellow, fine-grained near the outside but
 granular toward the core, melting, tender, buttery, very juicy, sweet
 and vinous, aromatic; quality very good to best. Core closed, with
 clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds large,
 wide, long, rather plump, acute, often abortive.

The fruits of Duchesse d'Angoulême excite admiration and wonder by
their enormous size. They may always be known by their great size,
squat pyriform shape, and uneven knobby surfaces. Well grown, the
pears have other virtues than size, as the flesh is buttery and
melting with a rich and delicious flavor; but poorly grown, and
on unfavorable soils, the flesh is granular, coarse-grained, but
half-melting and nearly devoid of the richness that characterizes
the fruits in happier situations. Size shrinks also when poorly grown,
so that one may say that a small pear of this variety is seldom fit
for dessert and too insipid for a good product in cookery. The trees
are vigorous, hardy, and healthy, bear abundantly under favorable
conditions, and succeed either as a standard or a dwarf. Possibly it
is best grown as a dwarf, and in America at least is more often worked
on the dwarfing quince than on the pear. In fact, this variety is
the favorite dwarf-pear for garden and home orchard, and commercial
orchards of dwarfed trees of it are not uncommon. On either stock, the
tree makes a beautiful, symmetrical pyramid, comes in bearing early,
and bears regularly. This variety is more popular in New York than in
any other part of America, and while less planted than formerly, is
still regarded as a standard late autumn variety. It is a particularly
desirable sort for the pear-fancier.

The original tree of Duchesse d'Angoulême was a wilding growing in a
garden near Angers, Maine-et-Loire, France. About 1808, M. Audusson, a
nurseryman at Angers, appreciating the beauty and excellent quality of
the pear, obtained the right to propagate it. In 1812 he began selling
trees of the variety under the name of "Poire des Eparonnais." In 1820,
M. Audusson sent a basket of the fruit to the Duchesse d'Angoulême
with a request for permission to name the pear in her honor, a request
which was granted. At the exhibition of the Massachusetts Horticultural
Society held in 1830, Samuel G. Perkins showed a specimen which
measured eleven and three-tenths inches. It was the only one that grew
on the tree, and was considered to be the first fruit of this variety
produced in America. The American Pomological Society added Duchesse
d'Angoulême to its catalog-list of fruits in 1862.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped,
 slow-growing, usually hardy, productive; trunk thick; branches stocky,
 shaggy, zigzag, dull reddish-brown overspread with scarf-skin, marked
 with small lenticels; branchlets thick, short, dull light brown,
 streaked with gray scarf-skin, smooth, glabrous, with many small,
 raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, conical, pointed, nearly free; leaf-scars
 prominent. Leaves 2-3/4 in. long, 1-5/8 in. wide, oval, thick,
 leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin marked with minute dark brown
 glands, crenate or nearly entire; petiole 1-3/4 in. long. Flower-buds
 large, long, conical, plump, free, arranged singly or in small
 clusters on short branches and spurs; flowers 1-3/8 in. across, 7 or 8
 buds in each cluster; pedicels 1 in. long, slender, lightly pubescent,
 greenish.

 Fruit ripe October to November; large, often very large, 4 in. long, 3
 in. wide, uniform in size, oblong-obovate-pyriform, with irregular and
 uneven surface and with sides often unequal; stem frequently 1-1/2 in.
 long, very thick, curved; cavity acute, deep, furrowed, irregular,
 often lipped; calyx partly open, small; lobes short, narrow, acute;
 basin medium to deep, abrupt, furrowed and uneven, often corrugated;
 skin thick, granular, roughened with russet; color dull yellow,
 streaked, spotted and netted with dull russet; dots numerous, russet,
 conspicuous; flesh white, firm becoming somewhat melting and quite
 tender when fully mature, granular, juicy, sweet, rich and delicious
 when fully mature; quality good to very good. Core closed, with
 clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds small,
 narrow, flat, acute, very often abortive.

In the middle of the last century this pear was heralded as one of the
best of the French varieties which were then coming to this country in
great numbers, but it is now almost lost to cultivation. While in no
way remarkable, the variety is too valuable to be discarded. As the
color-plate shows, the fruits are prepossessing in appearance. The
pears are bright yellow, with a brilliant cheek, the whole fruit being
more or less mottled with golden russet. Few pears are smoother of skin
or more symmetrical in shape, and the fruits are more uniform in size
than those of most varieties. The quality, as well as the appearance,
is pleasing. While the flesh is a little dry and not as rich in flavor
as that of most other varieties of its season, it is so crisp and
refreshingly piquant in contrast to the sweeter, buttery pears with
which it ripens, its season being just after that of Bartlett, that the
variety finds favor with all who like pears. The variety fails in its
tree-characters. Thus, the trees are late in coming in bearing; are not
very vigorous; are somewhat tender to cold; and do not resist blight
well. The variety has little value for commercial places, but if the
trees can be obtained, is well worth planting in the home orchard.

This pear is a chance seedling found by M. Maurier near Angers,
Maine-et-Loire, France, nearly a century ago. It was propagated by M.
Flon, a nurseryman of Angers and fruited first in 1839. In England
and America the variety has been chiefly known as Duchesse d'Orléans,
but many French horticulturists have used the name Saint-Nicolas. The
variety was added to the fruit-catalog list of the American Pomological
Society in 1862, but was dropped from the list in 1871.

 Tree medium in size and vigor, spreading, moderately productive;
 trunk slender, shaggy; branches medium in thickness and smoothness,
 reddish-brown partly overspread with thin gray scarf-skin, with few
 indistinct lenticels; branchlets short, with short internodes, light
 brownish-red mingled with green and partly covered with thin, gray
 scarf-skin, dull, smooth, glabrous, with conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds long, narrow, sharply pointed, plump, free. Leaves 3 in.
 long, 1-1/2 in. wide; apex taper-pointed; margin tipped with small,
 brownish glands, coarsely serrate; petiole 2 in. long, glabrous,
 reddish-green. Flower-buds long, conical, sharply pointed, free,
 singly on numerous short spurs; flowers showy, 1-3/8 in. across,
 in dense clusters, average 7 buds in a cluster, the petals widely
 separated at the base; pedicels 7/16 in. long, slender, lightly
 pubescent.

 Fruit matures in late September and October; medium in size, 2-7/8
 in. long, 2-1/4 in. wide, obovate-acute-pyriform, symmetrical; stem 1
 in. long, thick; cavity lacking, the flesh drawn up in a symmetrical
 fold about the stem; calyx small, open; lobes separated at the base,
 narrow, acute; basin very shallow, narrow, obtuse, smooth or slightly
 wrinkled; skin thin, tender, smooth; color yellow overlaid with a red
 blush, faintly mottled with golden russet; dots numerous, whitish or
 russet, conspicuous; flesh tinged with yellow, firm, granular, crisp,
 juicy, subacid; quality good. Core small, closed, axile, with meeting
 core-lines; calyx-tube short, conical; seeds long, plump, acute.

The unattractive little fruits of this pear would have small value were
it not for the fact that they are delicious in quality and come into
edible condition late. The fruits are of the type of those of Winter
Nelis, differing in shape somewhat, but are even better in quality and
keep longer. The fruits are further distinguished by a musky taste and
perfume, which make them especially agreeable to those who like rich,
sweet, perfumed pears. The trees, while in no characters remarkable,
are better than most of their orchard associates, and far superior to
the unmanageable trees of Winter Nelis with which this variety must
compete. After a probationary period of a half century in America,
Duhamel du Monceau has not found favor with commercial orchardists,
but pear fanciers value it for its delectable late-keeping fruits.
Nurserymen find the trees rather difficult to grow.

Duhamel du Monceau was obtained from seed by André Leroy, the eminent
author and pomologist at Angers, France. In naming the variety, M.
Leroy said that his purpose was to do honor to the memory of the
illustrious professor who filled an important place in pomology, and
who, in giving us the _Traité des arbres fruitiers_ published in
1768, rendered and still renders valuable services to horticulturists.
The original tree began to fruit in 1862 and was cataloged by Leroy
in 1865. The variety seems to have been described first in America by
Downing in 1876.

 Tree vigorous, upright, dense, hardy; trunk stocky; branches thick,
 zigzag, dull brownish-red, covered with ash-gray scarf-skin, marked
 with numerous large lenticels; branchlets very thick, short, with
 short internodes, brownish-red, tinged with green, dull, smooth,
 glabrous, with many conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds long, obtuse, appressed; leaf-scars prominent. Leaves 3
 in. long, 1-7/8 in. wide, long, folded lengthwise with the margins
 curled under, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin entire or coarsely
 crenate; petiole 2 in. long, slender. Flower-buds large, long,
 conical, plump, free, singly on short spurs; blossoms open late;
 flowers 1 in. across, well distributed, averaging 7 buds in a cluster;
 pedicels 1-3/16 in. long, slender, pubescent, pale green.

 Fruit ripe October to November; above medium in size, 3-1/8 in.
 long, 2-1/2 in. wide, uniform in size, roundish-pyriform or at times
 oblong-pyriform, symmetrical, with equal sides; stem 1 in. long,
 slightly curved, thick; cavity lacking, the stem being attached to
 the smooth, flat surface; calyx open; lobes separated at the base,
 short, obtuse or acute; basin shallow, obtuse, gently furrowed,
 small; skin thin, tender, roughened by the russet skin, dull; color
 greenish-yellow overspread with solid russet, or splashed, spotted
 and sprinkled with russet, the cheek often solid russet; dots many,
 small, russet, obscure because of the russet color, slightly raised;
 flesh yellowish-white, granular especially around the core, melting,
 buttery, very juicy, vinous; quality very good. Core variable in size,
 closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical;
 seeds elongated-oval, wide, plump, acute.

The fruits of Early Harvest are so poor in quality and rot at the
core so soon after ripening, that the variety is hardly worth growing
in New York, where there are many better pears of its season. To
offset these defects, the pears are large and handsome for early
fruits, and the trees are healthy and regular and heavy bearers. The
pear is characterized by a thick, fleshy stem and a large closed
core. Nurserymen report that the tree is difficult to propagate, and
fruit-growers find that it is slow in coming in bearing; the growth is
usually straggling and difficult to manage in nursery or orchard. The
variety is more popular in the Middle West than in any other part of
the country.

This variety appears to have been brought to Middletown, Kentucky,
from Maryland by Captain William Chambers about 1800, with several
other varieties. According to the rules of pomological nomenclature,
this pear should be called Chambers as it was first known. The name
Early Harvest was given the variety by Kentucky growers because of its
extreme earliness, and became so closely associated with the variety
that today it is the only one with which the public is familiar. In
1875 this variety was added to the fruit catalog-list of the American
Pomological Society under the name Chambers.

 Tree large, very vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped, very
 hardy, productive with age, long-lived; trunk very stocky, shaggy;
 branches thick, shaggy, zigzag, dull reddish-brown mingled with green
 and heavily covered with grayish scarf-skin, marked with numerous,
 large, elongated lenticels; branchlets very thick, straight, long,
 with long internodes, dull olive-green mingled with light brown,
 smooth, glabrous, with numerous very conspicuous, raised lenticels,
 variable in size.

 Leaf-buds small, short, obtuse, appressed; leaf-scars prominent.
 Leaves 3-1/8 in. long, 2-3/8 in. wide; apex very abruptly pointed;
 margin glandless, varying from finely serrate to entire; petiole 1-5/8
 in. long, slender. Flowers open early, showy, 1-1/8 in. across, well
 distributed, average 7 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1 in. long, thinly
 pubescent.

 Fruit ripens in August; large, 3-1/2 in. long, 3 in. wide,
 obovate-obtuse-pyriform, symmetrical; stem very thick, fleshy at
 its juncture with the cavity; cavity obtuse, shallow, narrow, often
 slightly wrinkled and drawn up in fleshy folds around the base of the
 stem; calyx small, open; lobes short, obtuse; basin shallow, narrow,
 obtuse, slightly wrinkled; skin thin, smooth; color pale yellow, more
 or less overspread on the exposed cheek with a pinkish blush, with
 stripes of carmine; dots numerous, small, greenish-russet, obscure;
 flesh yellowish, firm, granular, crisp, somewhat tough, variable in
 juiciness; quality poor. Core large, closed, axile, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube very long, narrow; seeds wide, short, plump,
 obtuse.

The fruit-books of Europe have so much to say in praise of Easter
Beurré that the variety has been tried time and time again in America,
but nearly always with unfavorable results. The variety grows well
only in comparatively warm climates and on light, warm, limy soils, and
refuses to ripen its crop in any others. There are occasional places
in eastern America where Easter Beurré can be well grown, but for most
part it is at home only on the Pacific slope. The fruits are of first
rate excellence when at their best, and add much to the winter supply
of pears, the product of few other winter pears surpassing that of this
sort from January to March in regions where it does well. The pears are
excellent shippers, keep well in common or cold storage, so that where
the variety succeeds it is valuable for home, and distant and foreign
markets. The trees are in every way satisfactory except that they bloom
a little earlier than other sorts, and are somewhat more susceptible
to the scab fungus in both fruit and foliage than a commercial variety
should be. Although a little too susceptible to blight, the trees are
above the average in immunity, and are hardy, vigorous, and productive.
The variety is well worth planting in soils and climates where the crop
matures properly.

In the gardens of the Capucin Monastery at Louvain, Belgium, there
was, about 1823, an old pear tree known to the monks as the _Pastorale
de Louvain_, which attracted the attention of Van Mons. He propagated
the pear and in due course distributed it. By the year 1853, it was
to be found pretty generally in the gardens of Belgium under the name
of _Pastorale_. Since that time it has been very widely disseminated,
but unfortunately has received a confusing variety of names, Leroy
mentioning twenty-four and Mathieu fifty-five. The leading authorities,
however, of England and this country have uniformly adopted the name
Easter Beurré. It was received in the former country soon after its
first dissemination, and it was brought to this country not later than
1837. Since 1862, Easter Beurré has appeared in the list of pears
recommended for general cultivation by the American Pomological Society.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped,
 slow-growing, hardy; branches reddish-brown overspread with gray
 scarf-skin, sprinkled with inconspicuous lenticels; branchlets
 variable in length, with short internodes, greenish-brown mingled with
 red, rough, glabrous, with small, round, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, very short, obtuse, free. Leaves 2-1/8 in. long,
 1-1/8 in. wide, thin; apex abruptly pointed; margin finely serrate,
 the teeth very short, tipped with red; petiole 2 in. long, slender.
 Flower-buds small, short, conical, plump, free, singly on short
 spurs; flowers 1-1/4 in. across, occasionally tinged with pink in the
 bud, becoming white when open, well distributed, average 9 buds in a
 cluster; pedicels 3/4 in. long, slender, pubescent.

 Fruit in season late December to February; 3 in. long, 2-3/8 in. wide,
 obovate-pyriform, with a short, thick neck; stem 3/4 in. long, thick,
 woody; cavity acute, very deep, narrow, furrowed, uneven, compressed;
 calyx open; lobes narrow, acute; basin deep, narrow, abrupt, furrowed
 and wrinkled; skin thick, tough, roughened by the dots, the surface
 uneven; color yellow, marked with many russet dots and with patches
 and veinings of russet, often with a dull brownish-red blush; dots
 numerous, small, very conspicuous, russet; flesh tinged with yellow,
 granular near the center and toward the calyx, tender and melting,
 juicy, buttery, sweet, with a rich, pleasant flavor, very aromatic;
 quality very good. Core large, closed, axile, with meeting core-lines;
 calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds large, wide, long, plump, acute.

Elizabeth is among the best summer pears for eastern America, either
for home consumption or for the markets. The characters which commend
it are: handsome, well-flavored fruits; and vigorous, hardy, productive
trees, which are as resistant to blight as those of any other European
pear, and which come in bearing early and bear annually. Faults
are: the fruits are small, a fault that can be overcome somewhat by
thinning; they are a little coarse in texture of flesh, which is a
little too gritty; and the flavor, while good for an early pear, is not
as sweet and rich as might be desired. The trees are nearly flawless,
failing, if at all, in not attaining as great size as some other
inhabitants of pear orchards. The crop is often borne in clusters--a
defect by reason of which the fruits are so often small. But even with
these defects, we must end as we began with the statement that this is
one of the best summer pears.

In the year 1819, Van Mons established his famous nursery at Louvain,
Belgium, and in the years 1830 and 1831 he sent from there two
consignments of pear cions to the Massachusetts Horticultural Society,
both of which were unfortunately lost in turn on the way. Three years
later, Kenrick, Manning, and Dearborn, Massachusetts horticulturists,
requested him to forward another collection. In the successive springs
of 1835 and 1836, he sent two more collections which safely arrived
in due course, though a large proportion of the cions died. These
collections comprised originally about 150 named and 100 seedling
unnamed varieties, and Van Mons granted Manning permission to name
any of the latter that might prove worthy of cultivation. No. 154 of
these, Mr. Manning[28] named _Elizabeth_ (_Van Mons_). Later on it
was disseminated as _Manning's Elizabeth_, and soon after the name
was shortened to i. The variety was placed in the fruit-list of the
American Pomological Society in 1854.

 Tree small, upright, dense-topped, hardy, very productive; trunk
 slender; branches brownish-green, partly overspread with thin, gray
 scarf-skin, marked by conspicuous, oval lenticels; branchlets slender,
 long, reddish-brown mingled with green, new growth exceptionally red,
 dull, smooth, glabrous except on the younger wood, with obscure,
 raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, pointed, plump, free. Leaves 3 in. long,
 1-1/2 in. wide, stiff; apex variable; margin almost entire; petiole
 2 in. long, slender, reddish-green; stipules very small and slender
 when present. Flower-buds small, short, conical, plump, free, singly
 on short spurs; flowers early, showy, 1-5/8 in. across, in dense
 clusters, average 8 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1 in. long, lightly
 pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in late August; small, 2-3/8 in. long, 2-1/2 in. wide,
 obovate-obtuse-pyriform, symmetrical, uniform; stem 1 in. long,
 thick, curved; cavity acuminate, shallow, narrow, symmetrical, often
 lipped; calyx large, almost closed; lobes separated at the base,
 short, narrow, acuminate; basin shallow, obtuse, gently furrowed and
 wrinkled; skin tough, characteristically rough, glossy; color bright
 yellow, with a lively, red cheek, mottled with brownish, minute
 specks; dots numerous, very small, conspicuous, russet or brown;
 flesh tinged with yellow, slightly granular under the skin, strongly
 granular at the center, tender and melting, very juicy, sweet, vinous,
 aromatic; quality very good. Core large, closed, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds wide, plump, acute.

At one time Flemish Beauty was a leading commercial variety in the
pear regions of eastern America, but it has been supplanted by other
varieties because the toll of blighted trees is too great, and the
fruits are too often disfigured by the scab fungus. Perhaps the latter
is the greater fault as in some seasons no applications of spray give
the pears a clean cheek, and they are blackened, scabbed, cracked and
malformed with this fungus. Not infrequently the scab-infected foliage
drops before the crop matures. To offset these defects, the trees
have to their credit great vigor, unusual fruitfulness and as great
hardihood to cold as those of any other variety. The trees do not come
in bearing early, and are not suitable for dwarfing as they overgrow
the quince stock. The fruits are nearly perfect if scab-free and
properly matured. To make sure of perfect maturity, the pears must be
picked as soon as they attain full size and be permitted to ripen under
cover. So treated, a bright-cheeked Flemish Beauty is as handsome as
any pear, and is almost unapproachable in quality; the flavor is nicely
balanced between sweetness and sourness, very rich, and has a pleasing
muskiness. Blight and scab condemn tree and fruit for commercial
orchards, but a lover of good pears should combat these troubles for
the sake of the choice fruits.

The parent tree of this variety is said to have been a wilding found
in a wood near Alost, East Flanders, Belgium, about the beginning of
the nineteenth century. It was cultivated under the Flemish name of
_Bosc Peêr_ or _Pear of the Woods_. About 1810, the propagation of
the variety was taken up by Van Mons who introduced it a few years
later under the name _Fondante des Bois_ by which name it was known in
Europe for many years. Lindley, writing in 1831, described this variety
under the name _Flemish Beauty_, and it appeared then to be in pretty
general cultivation in England. Styling it _Barnard_, Hovey wrote, in
1851, that Flemish Beauty "had been known in Dorchester, Massachusetts,
for nearly twenty years," so that it is to be inferred that the variety
was introduced to this country prior to 1830 and possibly by some
one by the name of Barnard. The rapid distribution of this pear was
promoted by Van Mons who gave numerous grafts of it to his friends
and correspondents. The fact that the variety has over sixty synonyms
may be taken as some testimony to its popularity and excellence. At
the first meeting of the American Pomological Society held in 1848,
Flemish Beauty was placed in the list of pears recommended for general
cultivation, a place it has since retained.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, spreading, with drooping branches,
 hardy, productive; trunk smooth; branches thick, shaggy, bright

It is doubtful whether this rather rare European pear can be purchased
from American nurserymen now, but possibly it may be had, and at least
it could be re-propagated from old trees. The fruit is distinguished by
its trim, top-shaped form and handsome coat, usually enlivened with a
dull color on the sunny side. The flesh, while gritty near the core,
is tender, juicy, buttery, very rich, sweet, and aromatic. It is just
the pear for those who prefer sweetness to vinousness or piquancy, and
who object to even a trace of astringency. The trees, while only medium
in size, are vigorous, hardy, healthy, and productive. If the variety
grows elsewhere as well as it does on the grounds of the New York
Agricultural Experiment Station it is too good to be lost. The fruits
are in season and at their best for Christmas.

This pear was raised from seed by Major Espéren, Mechlin, Belgium.
The tree fruited first in 1842 and was given the name _Fondante de
Noël_ to indicate the day on which it was tasted for the first time.
In 1862 a pear called _Souvenir d'Espéren_, attributed to seed grown
by Berckmans, a noted Belgian horticulturist living in the United
States, was put forth, but after examination there did not appear to
be any difference in either the fruit or the wood of this tree from
that of the variety grown by Major Espéren. Because the name _Souvenir
d'Espéren_ appears in connection with _Fondante de Noël_, the variety
has been confused with another pear which was raised by Major Espéren
and named _Souvenir d'Espéren_. The two, however, are entirely distinct
and the last-named sort has long been known and is still found growing
in certain pear orchards of the eastern United States.

 Tree medium in size and vigor, upright, hardy, productive; trunk
 thick, smooth; branches brownish-green, nearly covered with gray
 scarf-skin; branchlets slender, with long internodes, smooth,
 glabrous, marked with conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds large, long, conical, plump, free. Leaves 3-1/2 in. long,
 1-1/2 in. wide; apex taper-pointed; margin glandless, finely serrate;
 petiole 2-7/8 in. long. Flower-buds large, long, plump, free, singly
 on short spurs; flowers showy, 1-1/2 in. across, white often tinged
 pink on the edges of the petals, average 9 buds in a cluster; pedicels
 7/8 in. long.

 Fruit matures December to January; large, 2-1/2 in. long, 2-3/4 in.
 wide, roundish-turbinate, irregular; stem 3/4 in. long, thick, woody,
 obliquely set; cavity obtuse, shallow, narrow, furrowed, often lipped;
 calyx small, nearly closed; basin narrow, obtuse, furrowed; skin
 roughened by russet dots and patches; color dull greenish-yellow, with
 many dots, flecks and patches of russet, often with a faint trace of
 brownish-red on the sunny side; dots numerous, small, russet, rather
 conspicuous; flesh white, gritty only near the core, tender, buttery,
 juicy, sweet, highly aromatic; quality good to very good; core large,
 with meeting core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide; seeds large, long,
 plump, acute.

The reader will discover no noteworthy characters in the description
of this pear; nor does the accompanying illustration make the variety
particularly alluring, although the color-plate scarcely does the
fruits justice in either size or color. The variety is to be found in
many old orchards in eastern America, but was long since relegated by
pear-growers to the limbo of nurserymen's catalogs. The only reason
for giving it a place in _The Pears of New York_ is that the variety
was once prominent, and references to it and comparisons with it are
so common in horticultural literature that pear-growers are certain to
want to know something about it. As the following description shows,
the variety is but mediocre in tree and fruit.

Early in the eighteenth century M. Lévêque, an architect, acquired
possession of an estate near Fontenay, France. A number of pear
seedlings were growing upon this property, one of which was so good as
to attract M. Lévêque's attention and he began propagating it in 1828.
Later he distributed cions of the variety to his friends under the name
_Poire de Fontenay_. Soon afterward the name was changed to _Jalousie
de Fontenay_, Leroy took the variety to the garden of the Horticultural
Society of Angers about 1835, from which place it was still more
widely disseminated. It soon found its way to America where it gained
early popularity. In 1862 the American Pomological Society listed this
variety in its fruit-catalog under the name _Jalousie de Fontenay_, but
shortened the name, in 1883, to _Fontenay_. In 1899, however, the name
disappeared from this catalog and has never been replaced.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright, dense-topped, hardy; trunk
 slender, smooth; branches slender, brown mingled with green, partly
 covered with thin, gray scarf-skin; branchlets thick, long, with
 short internodes, light brownish-green, faintly tinged with red,
 dull, the new growth pubescent near the ends, smooth, with numerous,
 conspicuous, small, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds very small, short, sharply pointed, free; leaf-scars with
 large, prominent shoulders. Leaves 3 in. long, 1-1/2 in. wide, very
 thick; apex taper-pointed; margin almost glandless, finely serrate;
 petiole 2 in. long, variable in size, glabrous; stipules very slender,
 tinged red. Flower-buds small, short, conical, free, singly on
 very short spurs; flowers late, showy, 1-3/4 in. across, in dense
 clusters, average 7 buds in a cluster; pedicels 5/8 in. long, lightly
 pubescent.

 Fruit matures in October; small, 2-5/8 in. long, 2 in. wide,
 oblong-acute-pyriform, symmetrical, with equal sides; stem 3/4 in.
 long, curved; cavity lacking, the flesh folded around the base of
 the stem, often lipped; calyx partly open; lobes broad, acute; basin
 shallow, narrow, obtuse, slightly wrinkled, symmetrical; skin thick,
 tough, smooth; color dull yellowish-green, netted and patched with
 russet, with a tinge of red on the exposed cheek; dots numerous,
 small, russet, obscure; flesh strongly granular at the center,
 tender and melting, very juicy, subacid; quality good. Core large,
 closed, axile, with meeting core-lines; calyx-tube short, narrow,
 funnel-shaped; carpels emarginate; seeds large, wide, long, plump,
 acute.

The pear fancier prizes Forelle for its singularly handsome and
distinctive fruits, which are also of very good quality. Forelle
pleases the eye as well as any pear for bright colors, and is
distinguished among fruits of its kind by its trout-like specklings
from which comes the name _Forelle_, the German name for trout. Looks
do not belie taste for the flesh is delicate and buttery, is highly
flavored, and satisfies those who regard high quality a prime requisite
in a pear. The trees are very satisfactory in warm soils and exposures,
but fail in heavy clays and cold climates. The variety is worth growing
for its beautiful and distinctive fruits.

Nothing is very certainly known of the origin of this pear, but it
seems highly probable that it had its birth in northern Saxony at
the beginning of the eighteenth century. From Germany it was taken
to Flanders, and from there introduced into England. In the latter
country, it was first fruited by Thomas Andrew Knight, President of
the Horticultural Society of London, who, in 1823, sent cions to the
Honorable John Lowell, President of the Massachusetts Horticultural
Society. Forelle became quite widely disseminated in the eastern
United States during the first half of the eighteenth century, and was
considered by many pomologists a pear of merit. At the present time,
however, the variety has almost disappeared from cultivation. Its place
has been filled by Vermont Beauty, a pear introduced from Vermont more
than forty years ago. It is not improbable that these two varieties are
identical. Vermont Beauty may be the old German pear renamed.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright, very hardy and very
 productive; branches few, dark brownish-red, sprinkled with numerous
 lenticels; branchlets long, pubescent on the youngest shoots. Leaves
 small, flat, roundish-ovate; flowers open early.

 Fruit ripens November to December; medium in size, 3 in. long, 2 in.
 wide, oblong-obovate-pyriform, with a neck variable in length; stem
 1 in. long, slender; cavity shallow, oblique, narrow, often lipped;
 calyx small, open; lobes broad; basin shallow, narrow, abrupt; skin
 smooth; color yellow, more or less overlaid with red, deepening to
 rich crimson next to the sun, profusely covered with grayish-russet
 dots which are margined or rayed with crimson; dots numerous, large
 and small, russet or grayish; flesh white, fine-grained, although
 slightly granular at the center, melting, buttery, juicy, aromatic,
 with a rich, vinous flavor; quality good. Core medium in size; seeds
 nearly black, of medium size.

Fox seems to have failed in the pear-growing regions of America,
in spite of its having several excellent characters in both fruit
and tree. The fruits are not quite attractive enough to sell on the
markets or to grace the table of the amateur, their rough, russet skins
detracting greatly from their appearance. When the skin is removed,
however, a better late fall pear cannot be found. The flesh is white,
fine in texture, very juicy, melting, and has a brisk, vinous flavor
and a pleasant aromatic smell and taste that at once place the quality
very high. The trees are but mediocre in the prime characters of a good
orchard plant, and condemn the variety for any purpose other than the
collector's plantation.

Fox is one of many seedlings originated by B. S. Fox,[29] San José,
California. Most of these seedlings were raised from seed of Belle
Lucrative and Fox is among this number. The exact date of origin
cannot be determined, but it is assumed to have been in the early
seventies. The variety is considered to be one of the best of Fox's
seedlings.

 Tree medium in size and vigor, upright-spreading, round-topped,
 moderately productive; trunk slender; branches stocky, smooth,
 greenish-brown overspread with grayish scarf-skin; branchlets thick,
 short, with short internodes, zigzag, glabrous, sprinkled with small,
 raised lenticels. Leaf-buds long, obtuse, pointed, free. Leaves 2-1/8
 in. long, 1-1/4 in. wide, thick; apex abruptly pointed; margin nearly
 entire to finely serrate. Flower-buds conical, pointed, free; flowers
 open early.

 Fruit ripens October to November; large, 3-1/8 in. long, 2-1/8 in.
 wide, oblong-obovate-pyriform; stem 1-1/2 in. long, very thick,
 curved, obliquely set; cavity very shallow or lacking, the flesh
 folded up around the base of the stem; calyx closed or slightly open,
 variable in size; lobes much separated at the base, short, broad,
 acute; basin shallow, narrow, very small, furrowed and compressed;
 skin thick, granular, tough, roughened by the russet dots; color
 russet-yellow, often with a russet-red blush on the side next to
 the sun, almost entirely overspread with russet; dots numerous,
 conspicuous, russet; flesh white, granular near the core, melting,
 very juicy, sweet mingled with a brisk, vinous flavor, richly
 aromatic; quality very good. Core large, closed; calyx-tube short,
 wide; seeds wide, plump, acute.

Frederick Clapp has a place on the pear list, because it is one
of the few good varieties with acidulous fruits. The refreshing,
piquant flavor, the tender, melting, very juicy flesh, and the bright
lemon-yellow color with only a trace of red give sufficient charm
and character to the fruits to make the variety desirable in every
collection of good pears. The fruits come in season with those of
Beurré Superfin, and surpass them in quality at least. The trees are
vigorous and healthy and form open, shapely, wide-spreading heads
that commend them for orchard management. They grow with rapidity and
vigor, come in bearing early, and are unusually fruitful. The variety
is seldom planted in commercial orchards, but it has a welcome place in
every home orchard fortunate enough to have it.

This pear was raised about 1870 by Lemuel Clapp, Dorchester,
Massachusetts, brother of Frederick and Thaddeus Clapp, all of whom
were the producers of large numbers of pear seedlings, several of which
have been named. In all probability this variety is a cross between
Urbaniste and Beurré Superfin. At various exhibitions and meetings of
the Massachusetts Horticultural Society in the years 1872, 1874, 1875,
and 1876 it was shown and favorably reported on, and in 1875 received
high praise in a report of the Massachusetts State Fruit Committee
to the American Pomological Society. In 1877 the latter Society
added Frederick Clapp to its list of fruits recommended for general
cultivation.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, with open top, hardy; trunk
 thick, shaggy; branches stocky, shaggy, zigzag, dull reddish-brown,
 overspread with thick ash-gray scarf-skin, marked with many small
 lenticels; branchlets thick, dull reddish-brown, tinged with green,
 smooth except for the lenticels, glabrous, with many small, raised
 lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, conical or pointed, plump, usually free.
 Leaves 3 in. long, 1-3/4 in. wide, ovate, stiff; apex taper-pointed;
 margin finely serrate, tipped with very fine, sharp-pointed,
 reddish-brown glands; petiole 1-1/2 in. long, slender, glabrous.
 Flower-buds small, short, conical, plump, free; flowers cup-shaped,
 often with a disagreeable odor, 1 in. wide, averaging 9 buds in a
 cluster; pedicels 1 in. long, thick, pubescent, pale green.

 Fruit ripe in October; medium in size, more than 2 in. long, 2-3/8
 in. wide, variable in size, roundish or obovate, irregular in shape;
 stem 3/4 in. long, thick; cavity variable in outline and smoothness,
 often with a fleshy fold drawn up around the base of the stem; calyx
 open; lobes short, broad, obtuse; basin deep, wide, abrupt, usually
 smooth, symmetrical; skin thin, tender, smooth; color lemon-yellow,
 often marked with flecks and mottlings of russet; dots numerous,
 small, russet, obscure; flesh with a very faint tinge of yellow,
 fine, tender, melting, characteristically juicy, sweet, with a rich
 sprightliness; quality very good. Core closed, axile, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube very short, wide, broadly conical; carpels
 obovate; seeds large, wide, long, plump, acute.

There are no good reasons why this pear should be grown, it having
received much more attention than it deserves during the half century
it has been in America. Perhaps it suffices to say that the fruits and
trees are in no way equal, except in size of fruit, to those of Seckel,
with which variety it would compete, although the crop ripens a little
later. While the pears are larger than those of Seckel, the yield is
not as great as the trees do not bear as regularly, nor abundantly.
The fruits are not as well flavored, nor as attractively colored. The
variety is still offered by many nurserymen, most of whom, however,
condemn it with faint praise.

According to Bunyard, Gansel Seckel was raised from seed a century ago
by a Mr. Williams of Pitmaston, Worcester, England. It was obtained by
crossing Seckel with Gansel Bergamot, whence its name.

Tree medium in size and vigor, upright-spreading, variable in yield;
branches slender, zigzag, sprinkled with numerous lenticels; branchlets
thick, light reddish-brown mingled with green, smooth, glabrous, with
small, roundish, raised, conspicuous lenticels. Leaf-buds small,
short, pointed, appressed. Leaves 2-1/4 in. long, 1-1/2 in. wide; apex
taper-pointed; margin tipped with few reddish glands, coarsely serrate;
petiole 1-1/4 in. long. Flower-buds small, short, conical, plump, free;
flowers open early, 1-1/4 in. across; pedicels 1/2 in. long.

Fruit ripens in late October and November; small to medium, 2-1/2
in. long, 2-3/8 in. wide, irregular, oblate-pyriform; stem 3/4 in.
long, stout; cavity variable in width, shallow, irregular; calyx
small, closed; lobes erect, acute; basin variable in width, deep; skin
roughened with russet, uneven; color pale yellow, overspread with thin
cinnamon-russet, sometimes faintly blushed on the exposed cheek; dots
distinct, cinnamon-russet; flesh yellowish-white, coarse, melting,
buttery, juicy, highly aromatic, with a rich perfume, sweet, but
without the spicy flavor of the Seckel; quality very good.

A few trivial differences separate Garber from Kieffer--the fruits of
both are poor. The pears ripen a week or two earlier than those of
Kieffer, are a little rounder, flatter at the ends, and some say are
a little better in quality--certainly they are no worse to eat out of
hand. The tree is hardy to heat and cold, and is much planted in the
southern states, and in the Mississippi Valley, North and South. The
variety might be sparingly planted in New York as an ornamental.

Garber is one of many seedlings of the Chinese Sand pear, raised by J.
B. Garber, Columbia, Pennsylvania, sometime previous to 1880. It is
supposed to be of hybrid origin. The variety was added to the American
Pomological Society's list of recommended fruits in 1891 where it has
since remained.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, productive
 with age; branches smooth, zigzag, reddish-brown partly covered
 with grayish scarf-skin; branchlets thick, with long internodes,
 smooth, glabrous, sprinkled with small, round, very conspicuous,
 raised lenticels. Leaf-buds small, short, pointed and with curved
 tips, appressed. Leaves 3-1/2 in. long, 2-1/4 in. wide, thick; apex
 taper-pointed; margin with very minute and reddish tips, finely
 serrate; petiole 2-1/4 in. long, thick. Flower-buds small, conical,
 sharply pointed, free.

 Fruit ripe September to October; large, usually roundish-oblong and
 tapering toward both ends; stem 1 in. long, stout, obliquely set;
 cavity small, narrow, often deep and furrowed; calyx variable in size,
 partly open; lobes slender; basin broad, abrupt, deep, furrowed;
 color pale yellow, often with a brownish-red blush on the exposed
 cheek; dots small, numerous, russet; flesh white, granular, crisp but
 tender, juicy, neither sweet nor sour but with a peculiar, pleasant
 flavor; quality inferior.

This old winter pear is nearly lost to cultivation, but is worth
growing because of the high quality of the fruit and because the
pear comes in season in early winter when there are few others. The
pears are not attractively colored, although in this character the
illustration does not do the fruit justice. The fruits are rich and
sugary without the least trace of acid, but when poorly grown are
often astringent. All agree that the quality is better in fruit from
dwarf trees in which form the variety grows very well; and that it is
better, also, when grown on heavy soils than on light ones. The fruits
keep and ship remarkably well. The trees are neither very large nor
vigorous, but are usually productive. The variety is in disrepute in
many localities because the crop does not always ripen well.

The Abbé of Mons, M. Hardenpont, a pioneer in pear-raising and a worthy
forerunner of Van Mons, raised this pear from seed about 1750 in his
garden at Mons, Belgium. The variety was introduced into France in
1806 by Louis Noisette, who had found it in the gardens of the Duc
d'Arenberg. In France it was known, therefore, as _Beurré d'Arenberg_,
and consequently became much confused with the true _Beurré d'Arenberg_
raised by Monseigneur Deschamps. In order to overcome this confusion
the name of the variety raised by M. Hardenpont was changed by a number
of prominent Frenchmen to Beurré d'Hardenpont, but the variety has
always been grown under both names in France. In 1820, M. Parmentier
of Enghien, Belgium, sent this pear to England under the name _Glou
Morceau_. (Glou, in the Walloon language, meaning _delicious_ or
_dainty_; morceau, French, _morsel_ or _bit_; hence, the translation
may be Delicious Morsel or Dainty Bit.) _Glou Morceau_ has long been
the popular name of the variety in England and America although, as
Bunyard says, "It is regrettable that the memory of the pioneer of
Pear raising, l'Abbé Hardenpont, is not commemorated in this fruit."
Glou Morceau was brought to America within a few years after its
introduction in England and rapidly found favor here as attested by
leading American pomologists. In 1862 the American Pomological Society
added the variety to its catalog-list of fruits under the name _Glou
Morceau_ as it has since remained.

 Tree medium in size and vigor, spreading, dense-topped, rapid-growing,
 productive; trunk stocky; branches thick, reddish-brown, nearly
 covered with gray scarf-skin, marked with numerous large lenticels;
 branchlets slender, short, light greenish-brown, overspread with gray
 scarf-skin, smooth, glabrous, with numerous, small, conspicuous,
 raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, very short, pointed, plump, appressed. Leaves 2-3/4
 in. long, 1-3/4 in. wide, thick, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin
 occasionally with very few, small glands, coarsely or finely serrate;
 petiole 2 in. long, thick, glabrous, greenish. Flower-buds small,
 short, conical, plump, free, singly on very short spurs; flowers late,
 showy, 1-1/4 in. across, in dense clusters, 8 to 11 buds in a cluster;
 pedicels 7/8 in. long, pubescent.

 Fruit matures November to December; large, 3-1/8 in. long, 2-3/4 in.
 wide, obovate-obtuse-pyriform, irregular, sides unequal, somewhat
 ribbed; stem 7/8 in. long, thick and woody, curved; cavity deep,
 narrow, russeted, deeply furrowed, compressed, lipped; _calyx_ open;
 lobes long, narrow, acute; basin deep, smooth, broadly furrowed;
 skin tender, very gritty, dull, roughened by russet; color pale
 greenish-yellow, covered with large and small patches and mottlings of
 light russet; dots numerous, small, conspicuous, light russet; flesh
 tinged with yellow, fine-grained except near the core and under the
 skin, tender, buttery, sweet, with a rich, pleasant, aromatic flavor,
 astringent near the skin; quality good to very good. Core closed,
 axile, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, broad, conical;
 seeds large, wide, long, plump, acute.

The fruits of Guyot bear strong resemblance to those of Bartlett, but
differ in being larger and rather more handsomely colored, ripen a
little earlier, have coarser flesh, and are very differently flavored.
The product can seldom compete with that of Bartlett, or even with
that of Clapp Favorite with which it ripens, because its season is
exceedingly transitory. Unless picked quite green and ripened indoors,
the pears rot at the center, and even when ripened under the best
conditions quickly become mealy and insipid. Taken at the proper
moment, the pears are better flavored than those of Bartlett, as they
are richer and have a more delicate taste and perfume than the musky
fruits of Bartlett. The trees are quite as satisfactory as those of
Bartlett, unless, possibly, they fall short somewhat in productiveness.
The variety is well worth planting in collections for its early,
handsome, well-flavored fruits.

Guyot was raised in the nurseries of the Baltet Brothers, Troyes,
France, about 1870. Within the next decade it was quite widely
distributed in France and England where it has since been esteemed as a
pear of the Bartlett type. It was first brought to America about 1885.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright, hardy, productive, a regular
 bearer; branches brownish, overlaid with thick scarf-skin, marked by
 small, round, indistinct lenticels; branchlets slender, very long,
 curved, with long internodes, reddish-brown mingled with green,
 smooth, glabrous, sprinkled with raised, conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, very short, pointed, appressed. Leaves 2-7/8 in.
 long, 1-3/4 in. wide; apex taper-pointed; margin glandular, variable
 in serration; petiole 2 in. long, thick, reddish-green. Flower-buds
 small, short, conical, plump, free, singly on very short spurs;
 flowers open late, showy, 1-1/4 in. across, in dense clusters, from 5
 to 8 buds in a cluster; pedicels 7/8 in. long, pubescent.

 Fruit ripens in early September; large, 3-1/4 in. long, 2-5/8 in.
 wide, oblong-obtuse-pyriform, irregular, with unequal sides; stem
 1-1/4 in. long, thick, curved; cavity obtuse, shallow, narrow,
 slightly russeted, drawn up on one side of the stem in a prominent
 lip; calyx large, open; lobes separated at the base, short, broad,
 acute; basin shallow, narrow, obtuse, furrowed; skin very thin,
 tender, roughish; color yellow, more or less mottled and with traces
 of russet, with a red blush on the exposed cheek; dots numerous,
 small, russet, conspicuous; flesh yellowish-white, granular, tender,
 moderately juicy, sweet mingled with sprightliness, aromatic; quality
 good. Core closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide,
 conical; seeds large, long, plump, acute.

Howell is everywhere condemned by faint praise. The variety is a little
too good to be discarded and not quite good enough to be generally
recommended. Its characters in tree and fruit are faulty by reason
of their mediocrity. After having said that the trees are not above
the average in vigor, healthfulness, hardiness, and fruitfulness, it
remains only to be said that their spreading tops make them desirable
orchard inhabitants and handsome dooryard ornamentals. The fruits
cannot be praised for attractive appearance or good quality, but they
are preëminently meritorious in that they are probably more often
uniform in appearance, quality, and freedom from the ravages of the
scab fungus than those of almost any other pear. These qualities make
Howell a most estimable variety for the home orchard where intensive
care cannot be given. The variety further commends itself to amateur
growers, because the trees bear early, annually, and abundantly. Howell
seems to be better suited to the middle western states than to the
eastern states.

In 1829 or 1830, Thomas Howell, New Haven, Connecticut, planted in his
garden seeds from a variety of pear known locally as the Jonah, a hard
and tough winter sort which seldom matures sufficiently to be regarded
as a dessert fruit. One of the trees resulting from these seeds came
into bearing in 1842 or 1843. Specimens were exhibited in Faneuil Hall
by the Massachusetts Horticultural Society in 1848 and were considered
to be "of the first class and worthy of cultivation in every place
where the soil and climate are congenial." In 1856, the Howell pear was
recommended for general cultivation by the American Pomological Society.

 Tree large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped; trunk thick; branches
 stocky, reddish-brown, overspread with gray scarf-skin, with few
 small lenticels; branchlets thick, short, dull reddish-brown, smooth,
 glabrous, with a few large, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds large, long, conical, free. Leaves 2 in. long, 1-1/8 in.
 wide, oval, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin finely serrate,
 hairy, tipped with very minute glands; petiole 1-1/2 in. long.
 Flower-buds large, long, conical, rather plump, free; flowers open
 early, 1-3/8 in. across, in dense clusters, from 7 to 15 buds in a
 cluster; pedicels 1-1/16 in. long, pubescent, greenish.

 Fruit ripe in late September and October; medium in size, 2-3/8 in.
 long, 2-1/4 in. wide, uniform in size and shape, round-obovate,
 symmetrical; stem 1 in. long, thick, straight; cavity obtuse, very
 shallow and narrow, often with almost no cavity, smooth, symmetrical;
 calyx open, small; lobes separated at the base, short, narrow, obtuse;
 basin obtuse, slightly furrowed, nearly symmetrical; skin smooth,
 dull; color pale lemon-yellow, marked on the side exposed to the sun
 with a trace of blush and with patches and tracings of russet; dots
 many, small, russet, very conspicuous; flesh yellowish-white, firm but
 tender, granular, melting, very juicy, sweet, with a rich, somewhat
 brisk, almost vinous flavor, aromatic; quality very good. Core rather
 large, closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide,
 conical; seeds long, plump, acute, frequently abortive.

There is much difference of opinion as to the value of Idaho in
America. Without question, the variety is of considerable worth in
parts of the Pacific Northwest, and especially in regions where
hardihood is a prime requisite. There, presumably, the fruits are
larger and better flavored than in the East. As the accompanying
plate shows, the pears are only medium in size on the grounds of this
Station, but they are attractive in color and of excellent taste. The
core is small, and the seeds are often abortive and sometimes wanting.
The flesh is tender, buttery and almost free from granulation, with
a rich, sweet, vinous flavor which make the rating for this fruit
"good to very good." In many regions the pears are large, rough, and
gross--sometimes a facsimile of Duchesse d'Angoulême. The trees are
dwarf and fruitful to a fault so that the pears often run small; they
are hardier than those of almost any other pear and bear annually. To
offset these good characters, however, the trees have the fatal fault
of blighting, so that the variety is of value only in regions where
blight is not an annual scourge of this fruit.

Idaho was raised from seed of an unknown variety about the year 1867
by a Mrs. Mulkey, Lewiston, Idaho, and, having been propagated by the
Idaho Pear Company, was first brought to public notice in the autumn
of 1886 by John H. Evans of Lewiston. In 1888 it was introduced to
Europe and was shown at the congress of fruit growers held at Geneva,
Switzerland, in 1899. Idaho is included in the American Pomological
Society's list of fruits recommended for general cultivation, having
been added to this list in 1899.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, very
 productive; trunk smooth; branches slender, smooth, reddish-brown
 overspread with much gray scarf-skin, sprinkled with many small
 lenticels; branchlets dull brownish-red, overlaid with scarf-skin,
 smooth, glabrous, with small lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, conical, pointed, free; leaf-scars prominent.
 Leaves 2-3/4 in. long, 1-4/5 in. wide, leathery; apex abruptly
 pointed; margin glandular, finely serrate; petiole 2 in. long.
 Flower-buds short, conical, very plump, free, singly on short spurs;
 flowers showy, 1-1/8 in. across, in dense racemes, average 8 buds in a
 cluster; pedicels 1-1/8 in. long, pubescent.

 Fruit matures in late September and October; medium in size, 2 in.
 long, 2-1/8 in. wide, roundish, slightly pyriform, symmetrical; stem
 1 in. long, thick, slightly curved; cavity acute, narrow, furrowed,
 slightly lipped; calyx closed; lobes broad, acute; basin shallow,
 obtuse, somewhat furrowed; skin thick and granular, tough, roughish;
 color dull lemon-yellow, tinged with green, dotted and streaked with
 russet, splashed with russet patches; dots numerous, small, russet,
 conspicuous; flesh dull white, tinged with yellow, firm, tender,
 buttery, juicy, sweet, rich, almost vinous; quality good to very
 good. Core closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide,
 conical; seeds wide, acute.

At one time the best second early pear, Jargonelle is now little grown
in America, native varieties having crowded it out. The crop ripens
two or three weeks before that of Bartlett, so that the pears come
on the market with those of Bloodgood and Dearborn, which, for most
situations, are better sorts. The fruits are as attractive as any of
their season and are unique in shape and in having a long, curved stem.
The quality leaves much to be desired. The flesh is coarse, rather
gritty, and the flavor lacks the rich sugary taste on the one hand, or
the refreshing piquancy on the other hand, of good pears. The fruits
rot at the core and the season is short. The crop should be picked
early and ripened in the house. The trees are large, vigorous and
sometimes very productive, but are coarse, untidy bearers, especially
when young, and are often uncertain in bearing. After setting the
faults against the merits of this variety, one must conclude that is it
too worthy to discard, but hardly good enough for a recommendation for
other than the home orchard or in the plantings of collectors.

Jargonelle is a patriarch among pears, being one of the oldest of
all varieties. Its name appears to be derived from Jargon, anciently
Gergon, a corruption of Groecum; whence Merlet, writing in 1675, infers
that the Jargonelle was the _Pyrum Tarentinum_ of Cato and Columella,
the _Numidianum Groecum_ of Pliny, and the _Groeculum_ of Macrobius.
So far as we know the earliest mention of the Jargonelle in England
is by John Parkinson, who, writing in 1629, mentions sixty-five
varieties of pears, among them being the _Peare Gergonell_. Stephen
Switser, who wrote in 1731, also names it. The vitality of the English
Jargonelle is remarkable; the trees, it is said, often live for 200
years. In Scotland the variety is cultivated as far north as pears will
grow. William Coxe, Burlington, New Jersey, writing in 1817 of the
Jargonelle, said, "This pear has not been much cultivated in America,
and almost always under false names."

 Tree large, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, rapid-growing, hardy,
 very productive, long-lived; trunk shaggy; branches reddish-brown
 overlaid with heavy gray scarf-skin, with large lenticels; branchlets
 slender, short, reddish-brown overlaid with gray, new growth brownish,
 dull, smooth, with numerous small, raised, very conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, pointed, plump, appressed or free. Leaves
 3-1/4 in. long, 2 in. wide, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin
 tipped with few small, black glands, finely serrate; petiole 3 in.
 long, slender, tinged with red, glabrous; flower-buds small, very
 short, conical, plump, singly on short spurs; flowers late, showy,
 1-1/2 in. across, in dense clusters, from 8 to 14 buds in a cluster;
 pedicels 1-3/8 in, long, pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in late August; large, 3-3/8 in. long, 2-3/16 in. wide,
 oblong-obovate-pyriform, with an acute neck; stem characteristically
 long and curved, 1-5/8 in. long; cavity lacking, the flesh folding
 up around the base of the stem, russeted, lipped; calyx open; lobes
 separated at the base, long, broad, acute; basin very shallow and
 narrow, obtuse, gently furrowed, compressed; skin smooth; color
 yellow, with a bright blush laid thinly over the exposed cheek in
 streaks and splashes; dots numerous, greenish-russet, very small,
 obscure; flesh yellowish-white, granular under the skin, gritty at the
 center, melting, very juicy, subacid, aromatic, vinous; quality very
 good. Core large, open, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube long,
 narrow, conical; seeds large, wide, long, plump, acute.

This old sort, very different from Jargonelle, is worthy of description
only to distinguish it from the much better and older pear of the
same name. A generation ago this French Jargonelle was much grown in
America, but has given way to better sorts. The pears are handsome, but
are poor in quality and are edible only a day or two after maturity
as they quickly rot at the center and become dry and mealy toward the
periphery.

The name Jargonelle is used in France to denote a group of pears.
This fact accounts for the confusion which exists among the names and
synonyms of several varieties of this class. The French Jargonelle is
said to have originated in Anjou, a former province in France, where it
was much cultivated and highly esteemed toward the end of the fifteenth
century.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright, the younger branches inclined to droop,
 very productive; branches stocky, dark reddish-brown; branchlets often
 curved and drooping, short, sprinkled with elongated, inconspicuous
 lenticels. Leaf-buds large, conical, appressed. Leaves oval, enlarged
 at the base; apex abruptly pointed; margin coarsely serrate; petiole
 long, thick. Flower-buds large, long-conic; flowers medium in size.

 Fruit ripens in August and September; medium to sometimes large, 3-1/2
 in. long, 2-1/2 in. wide, obtuse-pyriform to oblong-pyriform; stem 1
 in. long, slender, obliquely inserted; cavity obtuse, very shallow;
 calyx small, open; lobes long, projecting; basin variable in depth,
 small, irregular, furrowed; skin smooth, glossy; color lemon-yellow,
 blushed with red on the sunny side, occasionally marbled with thin
 orange-russet about the neck; dots light greenish or russet; flesh
 white, coarse, juicy, sweet, aromatic; quality good. Core large; seeds
 dark brown, small, narrow, long, often abortive.

This is another of the few good winter pears. The fruit-characters
are so distinctive and meritorious that the variety should be grown
in every home orchard, and it possesses much merit for commercial
plantations. The fruits have a marked peculiarity. Cut through the
shaded yellow-russet skin, flesh with a faint, rosy tint is displayed.
Several red or rosy-fleshed pears are grown in Europe, but this is
the only one described by American pomologists. The tree also, has a
marked peculiarity; it thrives amazingly well on the white-thorn as
well as on pear and quince stocks. But it is the quality of the fruits
that commends the variety most highly. The flesh is buttery, juicy,
sweet, and perfumed--pleasing in every character that gratifies the
palate. The season is exceedingly variable, and is given by different
pomologists from December to March and January to May. The fruits are
not very pleasing in appearance, but the accompanying illustration
scarcely does them justice in either size or color. In the orchard, the
trees are satisfactory, but the nurserymen find them rather difficult
to grow, this, no doubt, being the chief reason for the apparent
neglect of this splendid pear. The trees thrive in almost any soil or
situation suitable to pears, and are everywhere prodigiously fruitful,
hardy, and resistant to blight. The variety deserves wider recognition
than it now receives.

This pear originated about 1830 in the seed beds of Major Espéren,
the well-known pomologist of Mechlin (Malines), Belgium, who named it
Joséphine de Malines in honor of his wife. It was introduced in America
prior to 1850, and in 1862 was added to the fruit-list of the American
Pomological Society, a place it has since retained.

 Tree large, vigorous, spreading, tall, dense-topped, rapid-growing,
 hardy, very productive; trunk stocky; branches thick, shaggy,
 reddish-brown overlaid with gray scarf-skin, marked with few
 lenticels; branchlets thick, dull reddish-brown, smooth, glabrous,
 with small, raised, inconspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds short, obtuse, plump, appressed. Leaves 2-1/4 in. long,
 1-1/4 in. wide, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin finely serrate;
 petiole 1-3/4 in. long. Flower-buds short, plump, free; flowers
 early, 1-3/8 in. across, white, occasionally tinged with pink, well
 distributed, average 7 buds in a cluster; pedicels 3/4 in. long,
 slender, thinly pubescent.

 Fruit ripe December to February; medium in size, 2-1/2 in. long, 2-3/8
 in. wide, turbinate, inclined to truncate; stem long, very thick;
 cavity obtuse, shallow, narrow, slightly furrowed; calyx large, open;
 lobes short, broad, obtuse; basin narrow, obtuse, smooth; skin thick,
 tough, dull; color pale greenish-yellow, netted and patched more or
 less with russet; dots numerous, small, brown or russet, conspicuous;
 flesh light salmon, granular, melting, buttery, very juicy, sweet,
 slightly aromatic; quality good. Core large, closed, axile, with
 clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide; carpels pyriform; seeds
 large, wide, long, plump, acuminate.

Although the most pretentious cheat in the orchard, Kieffer is grown
more commonly than any other pear in North America. Its popularity can
be accounted for only by accepting Barnum's dictum that "Americans
love to be fooled." Pears are grown to eat, but those of Kieffer
are fit to eat only in culinary preparations, dire necessity alone
compelling their consumption uncooked. Yet, pleased by a bright cheek
and a fair form, regardless of the potato-like flavor, people buy and
eat Kieffer pears and persist in doing so. There are several reasons
why Kieffer is popular. No pear has been advertised so widely and so
unqualifiedly, growers of trees often supplying virtues to the variety
which Nature denies it, because of all pears the trees of Kieffer are
most easily grown. Besides this virtue in the trees there are several
others that commend the variety more highly. Thus, of all pears grown
in America, the trees are uniformly the most vigorous, fruitful,
endure heat best, are least susceptible to blight, and withstand best
the ravages of San José scale. There are several faults, however; the
trees are tender to cold, in some soils refuse to set fruit, are often
self-sterile, and sometimes with the best of care bear only pears of
small size. Worthless for dessert, much can be said for the fruits of
Kieffer for culinary preparation. Cooking removes the disagreeable
natural taste of the raw pear, and leaves a good product. Canned,
the pears retain their shape, color, and flavor well; therefore, and
because white and inviting, canned Kieffers are preferred by commercial
canners. Use in the cannery is the true place for Kieffer pears in
regions where better sorts can be grown for dessert. Now that the
first flush of popularity is past, it would seem a wise precaution on
the part of pear-growers to grow this fruit chiefly for the cannery,
supplying the demands for dessert pears with worthier varieties,
although as long as consumers buy it to eat out of hand, growers cannot
be blamed for growing it in commercial orchards.

The seed parent of Kieffer was the Sand pear of China. Peter
Kieffer,[30] who lived at Roxborough, near Philadelphia, for many
years grew the Chinese Sand pear and sold the trees for ornamental
purposes. In his garden there were also trees of Bartlett. Among chance
seedlings, Mr. Kieffer observed one of peculiar growth which he saved.
This tree bore fruit first in 1863. Later, it was exhibited at the
Massachusetts Horticultural Society, and finally at the Centennial
Exposition where in 1876 it was named Kieffer. The variety was added to
the fruit-list of the American Pomological Society in 1883.

 Tree of medium size, vigorous, upright, dense-topped, hardy, very
 productive; branches slender, nearly smooth, reddish-brown, covered
 with dull ash-gray scarf-skin, marked with few small lenticels;
 branchlets medium to long, reddish-brown mingled with green, smooth,
 slightly pubescent, with numerous, large, raised, very conspicuous
 lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, obtuse, slightly pointed, appressed.
 Leaves 3-1/4 in. long, 1-3/4 in. wide, oval, thick, leathery; apex
 taper-pointed; margin often finely serrate; petiole 1-7/8 in. long.
 Flower-buds conical to pointed, free; flowers open early, 1-5/8 in.
 across, fairly well distributed, varying from 3 to 11 buds in a
 cluster; pedicels 1-1/8 in. long, thick, very slightly pubescent,
 green, rarely tinged red.

 Fruit matures in late October and November; above medium to large,
 2-3/4 in. long, 2-1/4 in. wide, oval, narrowing at both ends,
 symmetrical, uniform; stem 1 in. long, thick; cavity very small,
 smooth; calyx open; lobes separated at the base, short, narrow, acute;
 basin shallow, narrow, obtuse, nearly smooth; skin thick, tough,
 smooth; color yellow, blushed with dull red on the exposed cheek;
 dots numerous, small, russet, conspicuous; flesh yellowish-white,
 very granular and coarse, crisp, juicy, not sweet, often astringent;
 quality poor. Core large, closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube
 short, wide, conical; seeds wide, plump, acute.

A summing up of the characters of Kingsessing, as is so often the
case with varieties of fruits, makes it appear a most desirable sort.
Nevertheless, its culture does not make headway. Growers rate it as a
"good pear," but will not grow it, for the reason, no doubt, that it
has no outstanding characters for any region, season, or purpose. As
the pears grow on the grounds of the New York Agricultural Experiment
Station they are a little under size for a good commercial fruit, and
while the sweet, perfumed flavor is pleasant, it lacks individuality.
The variety is grown chiefly along the Atlantic Coast from Long Island
to Maryland.

This is a natural seedling which sprang up in the family burial ground
of Isaac Leech, Kingsessing, a suburb of Philadelphia, about 1833.
The tree first fruited about 1843. Dr. Brincklé, who introduced the
variety, thought from its close resemblance to Chapman that it was
probably a seedling from it, or of its parent, the Petre, as trees of
both these varieties stood in the vicinity of the Kingsessing. The
American Pomological Society placed Kingsessing on its fruit-list in
1858 but dropped it in 1899.

 Tree very large and vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped,
 rapid-growing, hardy, medium in yield; trunk very thick; branches
 very stocky, grayish-brown, sprinkled with numerous large lenticels;
 branchlets thick, long, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with numerous rather
 small, raised, conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds large, long, conical, free. Leaves 2-1/4 in. long, 1-3/8 in.
 wide; apex abruptly pointed; margin glandular, finely serrate; petiole
 1-3/4 in. long. Flower-buds large, conical, free.

 Fruit ripens in September and October; medium in size, 2-3/8 in.
 long, 2-1/8 in. wide, obovate-obtuse-pyriform; stem 1/2 in. long,
 thick, usually curved, fleshy at the point of insertion in the fruit;
 cavity obtuse, shallow, slightly furrowed, occasionally lipped; calyx
 partly open; lobes separated at the base, short, narrow, acute; basin
 shallow, gently furrowed, usually symmetrical; skin granular, tender,
 roughish; color yellow, sprinkled and netted with russet, with a thin
 brownish-red blush on the exposed cheek; dots numerous, grayish or
 russet, small, conspicuous; flesh white, granular, tender and melting,
 sweet, aromatic; quality good. Core closed, with clasping core-lines;
 calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds wide, long, plump, acute.

Koonce is a popular early variety grown rather commonly in nearly
every pear region in the United States. It is listed by nearly all
nurserymen. Its tree-characters are more notable than those of its
fruits. The trees make a splendid showing in the nursery and are hardy
and productive in the orchard, although of but medium size and rather
straggling at maturity. The pears are better in quality than those of
Early Harvest or Lawson, with which it often competes, but are hardly
as attractive in appearance, being rather small and often irregular in
shape. The color is unusually bright, especially on the red cheek. The
pears decay quickly after maturity and are suitable only for home and
local markets.

This pear originated in southern Illinois but no one seems to know by
whom, or at what time, or in what locality in the State. The variety
has been grown for more than thirty years. The American Pomological
Society added Koonce to its list of fruits in 1909.

 Tree medium in size and vigor, upright-spreading, scraggly,
 open-topped, hardy, productive; trunk shaggy; branches zigzag,
 dark brownish-red, covered with thick grayish scarf-skin, with few
 lenticels; branchlets thick, long, with long internodes, dull light
 brown, smooth, glabrous, sprinkled with small, raised, elongated
 lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, conical, pointed, plump, appressed; leaf-scars
 prominent. Leaves 2-1/2 in. long, 1-1/2 in. wide, stiff; apex
 taper-pointed; margin glandular, finely serrate; petiole 1-1/2 in.
 long. Flower-buds short, obtuse or conical, plump, free; flowers
 showy, 1-1/4 in. across, in dense clusters, average 5 buds in a
 cluster; pedicels 7/8 in. long, slender, pubescent.

 Fruit ripens in August; medium in size, 2-3/8 in. long, 2-1/4 in.
 wide, obovate-obtuse-pyriform, with unequal sides; stem 1-1/4 in.
 long, thick; cavity obtuse, shallow, narrow, compressed, lipped
 or often drawn up in a wrinkled fold about the base of the stem;
 calyx open; lobes separated at the base, narrow, acuminate; basin
 obtuse, gently furrowed; skin thick, tough, roughish; color pale
 greenish-yellow, with a dull reddish-brown blush spreading over
 the exposed cheek; dots numerous, very small, greenish-russet,
 conspicuous; flesh whitish, granular especially at the center, medium
 tender, juicy, aromatic, sweet but vinous; quality good. Core small,
 closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical;
 seeds small, narrow, short, plump, acute.

As the history shows, this is an old European pear which had its
probationary period in America many years ago, and which never got out
of the limbo of nurserymen's catalogs and collections. On the grounds
of the New York Agricultural Experiment Station, however, the pears are
so handsome and so delectable in quality that the variety seems quite
worth while describing and illustrating among the major sorts. It is
a splendid pear for the home orchard, but the tree is not large nor
robust enough for a commercial plantation. A few nurserymen still list
it.

This variety was raised from seed about 1828 by M. Bouvier, Jodoigne,
Belgium. It was first named _Beurré Curtet_ in honor of M. Curtet, a
physician and professor at Brussels. The London Horticultural Society
first obtained the variety under the name _Comte de Lamy_, by which
name it has best been known in England. Lamy was early introduced to
America where trees have long been found in collections.

 Tree small, spreading, open-topped, hardy, productive; trunk slender,
 shaggy; branches slender, shaggy, dull brown, overspread with thick
 scarf-skin, sprinkled with numerous lenticels; branchlets slender,
 curved, short, with short internodes, brown changing to reddish-brown
 on the newer growth, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with small, raised,
 conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, conical, pointed, plump, free. Leaves 2-3/4
 in. long, 1-3/4 in. wide, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin finely
 serrate to nearly entire, tipped with few minute glands; petiole 1-7/8
 in. long, pinkish. Flower-buds large, thick, long, conical, very
 plump, free, singly as lateral buds or on very short spurs; flowers
 late, very showy, 1-3/4 in. across, in dense clusters, average 9 buds
 in a cluster; pedicels 5/8 in. long, thick, lightly pubescent.

 Fruit matures in late October and early November; medium in size,
 2-1/8 in. long, 2 in. wide, obovate-obtuse-pyriform, often irregular
 and with unequal sides; stem 1-1/8 in. long, thick; cavity almost
 lacking, very obtuse and shallow, narrow, russeted, often lipped;
 calyx open; lobes broad, acute; basin rather deep, obtuse or abrupt,
 gently furrowed, compressed; skin thin, smooth except for the russet
 dots, dull; color yellow, with a solid, dark red blush on the exposed
 cheek; dots numerous, large, brownish-russet, very conspicuous; flesh
 tinged with yellow, granular at the center, tender and melting,
 buttery, juicy, sweet, with a faint, vinous flavor, pleasantly
 aromatic; quality good to very good. Core large, closed, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube short, very wide, conical; seeds large, wide,
 plump, acute.

There is great diversity of opinion as to the value of Lawrence for a
market pear, but no one denies it a place as one of the very best early
winter pears for the home orchard. A generation ago it was held in
high esteem as a market pear, but the more showy Kieffer, kept in cold
storage, has elbowed the less conspicuous Lawrence off the fruit-stands
and almost out of the markets. The tree is hardy, moderately vigorous
and fruitful, an early, annual, and uniform bearer, and has the
reputation of being one of the longest lived of all pear trees. The
fruits are of but medium size, but are shapely in form, trim in
contour, and are distinctive in shape because of the rounded, truncate
stem end. In color, the pear is a bright, clean lemon-yellow marked
with patches of russet and faintly blushed on the side to the sun. No
yellow pear is more attractive. The fruits come in season in early
winter and have the excellent character of keeping well under ordinary
care for a full month or longer. The melting flesh abounds with a rich,
sugary, perfumed juice, by virtue of which it is justly esteemed as the
best-flavored pear of its season. Lawrence finds congenial soils and
climates in nearly every part of New York, and should have a place in
every home orchard in the State.

Lawrence is a native of Flushing, Long Island, and was first introduced
to growers by Wilcomb and King of Flushing, who sent specimens of it
in 1843 to the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, saying that it
appeared to be a cross between the old Saint Germain and White Doyenné,
"as it resembles both of them in wood, foliage, and fruit, and there
is no other variety in the neighborhood." The variety rapidly found
favor among pear growers and was soon widely disseminated. The American
Pomological Society added Lawrence to its fruit-catalog in 1854.

 Tree of medium size, vigorous, spreading, with drooping branches,
 very hardy, productive; trunk shaggy; branches smooth, zigzag,
 reddish-brown mingled with ash-gray scarf-skin, with numerous large
 lenticels; branchlets reddish-brown, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with
 slightly raised, conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds short, obtuse, plump, nearly free. Leaves 2-1/2 in. long,
 1-1/4 in. wide, oval, leathery; margin finely serrate; petiole 1-3/4
 in. long, slender; stipules rudimentary. Flower-buds hardy, conical
 or pointed, free; flowers open early, 1-3/8 in. across, in rather
 dense clusters, from 8 to 12 buds in a cluster; pedicels 7/8 in. long,
 lightly pubescent, greenish.

 Fruit ripe November to December; medium in size, 2-5/8 in. long,

Of all early pears, the fruit of Lawson best satisfies the eye for
bright colors. It is as brightly colored as the brilliant Vermont
Beauty or as Mount Vernon. Another outstanding character is the
small core, which, though the pears ripen early and quickly, seldom
softens unduly. The pears are sometimes nearly or quite seedless.
Unfortunately, the fruits are often irregular in shape, and in quality
are never more than mediocre. The tree is fairly healthy, vigorous,
hardy, and free from blight, and is characterized by its tall, upright
growth. Although grown for more than a hundred years in New York,
the variety has never made headway in this State, but seems to be
attracting much attention on the Pacific slope.

This pear originated on the farm of a Mr. Lawson in Ulster County, New
York, about 1800, judging from the appearance of the original tree
which was standing in 1900. The variety was introduced toward the end
of the nineteenth century under the name _Comet_ by reason of its
color, so that it is sometimes known as _Lawson Comet_. The American
Pomological Society added Lawson to its fruit-catalog in 1899.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright, dense-topped, very productive;
 branches slender, zigzag, reddish-brown overlaid with grayish
 scarf-skin, marked with numerous raised, large lenticels; branchlets
 slender, very long, with characteristically long internodes, rough,
 zigzag, marked with numerous large, raised, conspicuous lenticels.
 Leaves 3-1/4 in. long, 1-3/4 in. wide; apex abruptly pointed; margin
 glandless, serrate; petiole 2 in. long. Flowers early, showy, 1-1/2
 in. across, in dense clusters, 6 or 8 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1
 in. long, thick.

 Fruit ripens in August; large, 2-3/4 in. long, 3-1/4 in. wide,
 varies from obovate-obtuse-pyriform to globular-obtuse-pyriform,
 with unequal sides; stem 7/8 in. long, thick, curved, woody; cavity
 very small and narrow, often with a lip drawn up around one side of
 the stem; calyx partly open; lobes narrow, often reflexed; basin
 narrow, obtuse, gently furrowed; skin thin, tender, smooth; color
 pale yellow, overspread on the exposed cheek with a bright red blush;
 dots numerous, small, greenish or russet, obscure; flesh whitish or
 often salmon-color, firm, tough, medium juicy, lacking sweetness;
 quality poor. Core unusually small, closed, with clasping core-lines;
 calyx-tube short, wide; seeds short, wide, plump, obtuse, few in
 number.

Le Conte is a hybrid between the Chinese Sand pear and a European sort,
therefore similar in parentage to Kieffer which it greatly resembles
in both tree and fruit. The fruits are rather poorer in quality than
those of Kieffer, if that be possible for an edible fruit, and the tree
is in no way superior to that of its better-known rival, but seems to
succeed better in warm climates and light soils. There is, therefore, a
place for Le Conte in the South, and possibly on parts of Long Island,
if a pear is wanted for culinary purposes only. The fruits sometimes
rot badly at the core, and should usually be harvested as soon as
they attain full size. The trees are more susceptible to blight than
those of Kieffer. In the South, the trees are often, if not usually,
propagated from cuttings.

Le Conte originated in America, and is probably a hybrid between the
Chinese Sand pear and some native. It is supposed to have been carried
from Philadelphia to Georgia about 1850 by Major Le Conte, and has
since been extensively cultivated in the southern States for northern
markets. In 1885 it was recommended by the Georgia Horticultural
Society for cultivation in the middle region of that State. The
American Pomological Society added Le Conte to its fruit-catalog in
1883.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright, very productive, a regular
 bearer; branches strongly zigzag, brownish-red mingled with green
 and covered with scarf-skin; branchlets thick, reddish-brown mingled
 with green, smooth, pubescent on the new growth which later becomes
 glabrous, with numerous very small, conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, pointed, appressed. Leaves 3-1/4 in. long,
 1-1/2 in. wide, long-ovate or long-oval, leathery; apex taper-pointed;
 margin finely serrate; petiole pale green, glabrous. Flower-buds
 small, short, conical, plump, free, arranged singly on very short
 spurs; flowers open very early, 1-1/4 in. across, in dense clusters,
 7 to 10 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1 in. long, slender, lightly
 pubescent, pale green.

 Fruit ripe late October to November; large, 3-1/16 in. long, 2-5/8 in.
 wide, uniform in size and shape, roundish-oval, tapering at both ends,
 ribbed, symmetrical; stem 1-1/8 in. long, very thick, often curved;
 cavity obtuse, very shallow and narrow, smooth, slightly furrowed
 and wrinkled, often compressed; calyx partly open; lobes usually
 dehiscent, separated at the base, short, narrow, acute; basin usually
 very deep, abrupt, gently furrowed; skin thick, tough, smooth; color
 pale yellow, occasionally marked with russet; dots numerous, small,
 russet, conspicuous; flesh white, firm, granular, stringy, tender,
 juicy, sweet, with a strong and disagreeable flavor; quality poor.
 Core very large, closed, axile, with meeting core-lines; calyx-tube
 short, wide, broadly conical; seeds large, 2 in each carpel, wide,
 long, very plump, acute.

In size and beauty of fruit, Le Lectier surpasses most of its
associates, and the quality is first rate in soils and climates to
which the variety is suited. Unfortunately the tree, while very
satisfactory in some situations, is capricious to both soils and
climates, and is seldom at home on this side of the Atlantic. The
season is December and January, when good pears are scarce, and it
would seem that the fine, large fruits of this pear would be most
acceptable for either home or market if it could be made to thrive. In
Europe, it grows best on warm, rich soils.

Auguste Lesueur, a horticulturist at Orléans, France, obtained this
late winter pear about 1882 as a cross between Bartlett and Fortunée.
It was named after Le Lectier, the great pomologist of Orléans,
who was growing in the year 1628 about 260 varieties of pears. The
variety was introduced about 1889. In France, Le Lectier has been
described as greatly superior in flavor, aroma, and sweetness to
varieties of the same class having established reputations. In 1894,
the Royal Horticultural Society of London recommended this variety for
cultivation in England.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright, dense-topped, very productive;
 trunk and branches medium in thickness and smoothness; branchlets
 thick, curved, light brownish-red, tinged with green and overspread
 with grayish scarf-skin, glabrous, sprinkled with numerous raised,
 conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds very small, short, pointed, plump, free. Leaves 2-7/8 in.
 long, 1-1/2 in. wide, thick; apex taper-pointed; margin glandular,
 finely serrate; petiole 2-1/4 in. long, slender. Flower-buds short,
 conical, plump, free, singly on very short spurs; flowers showy, 1-1/2
 in. across, 8 or 10 buds in a cluster; pedicels 7/8 in. long.

 Fruit ripens December to January; large, elongated-obovate-pyriform,
 often with a narrow neck; stem slender, rather short, enlarged at
 both ends, inserted obliquely; cavity irregular, often lipped;
 calyx variable in size, partly open; basin variable in size,
 abrupt, irregular; skin glossy, thin, with uneven surface;
 color yellow, mottled and faintly blushed on the exposed cheek
 with yellowish-bronze; dots inconspicuous, small; flesh white,
 fine-grained, melting, juicy, sweet, pleasantly aromatic; quality very
 good.

A century ago this pear was being heralded in Europe as the best of
all pears, and shortly afterward was introduced into the United States
with highest praise. The variety is still popular in Europe, but its
reputation there is not sustained here. The pear deserves a place among
major varieties only because it fills a particular niche in the pear
season, the crop coming in season between late fall and early winter
at a time when there are few other good varieties. Were it not for one
serious fault, however, the variety might take high rank in America.
The fault is great susceptibility to the scab fungus. After Flemish
Beauty, no other variety suffers as much both in fruit and foliage.
Well grown in a congenial environment, on standard or quince stock,
the pears are often as large as those of Duchesse d'Angoulême, with
which they compare rather closely in shape. On well-grown specimens,
also, the color is rich and beautiful. The flavor is sprightly and
refreshing, which, with good flesh-characters, give the variety high
rank for quality. There are no remarkable characters in the trees
to recommend them, although they are quite up to the average in all
characters either on pear or quince stocks. They are said to prefer a
rich, deep soil. The variety is suitable only for collections.

This pear was obtained by M. Léon Leclerc, a distinguished pomologist
living at Laval, France, who dedicated it to his friend Van Mons.
Desiring to couple his own name with that of his friend, he gave it the
name of _Van Mons Léon Leclerc_, by which appellation it has been known
by most authors. The variety first fruited in 1828. There has been a
good deal of confusion as to the identity of this pear, owing to the
fact that Van Mons raised a pear in 1816 which he dedicated to Léon
Leclerc. The proper name of the latter pear is _Léon Leclerc de Laval_.
There is also a _Léon Leclerc de Louvain_. The variety under discussion
was fruited in this country previous to 1843 by Marshall P. Wilder. The
American Pomological Society added the variety to its fruit-catalog in
1862 but dropped it in 1869.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, productive;
 trunk shaggy; branches roughish, reddish-brown, overspread with
 heavy, dull scarf-skin, with conspicuous, numerous, large lenticels;
 branchlets very slender and curved, short, with short internodes,
 light brown streaked with gray and tinged with green, dull, smooth,
 glabrous, with numerous small, conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds very small, short, pointed, appressed. Leaves 1-1/2 in.
 long, 3-1/4 in. wide, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin glandless,
 entire; petiole 1-1/2 in. long, glabrous, reddish-green. Flower-buds
 small, short, conical, plump, free, singly on short spurs; flowers
 showy, 1-1/4 in. across, in dense racemes, 7 or 8 buds in a cluster;
 pedicels 5/8 in. long, pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in late September and October; large, 3-3/8 in. long,
 2-1/4 in. wide, oblong-pyriform, tapering to a very long, narrow
 neck; stem 1 in. long, thick, curved; cavity very small, compressed,
 usually lipped; calyx large, open; lobes separated at the base, broad,
 acute; basin shallow, narrow, obtuse, symmetrical; skin thick, tough,
 roughened by russet specks; color dull yellow, covered with dots and
 tracings of russet and occasionally with a faint russet-red blush;
 dots numerous, small, russet, conspicuous; flesh granular under the
 skin, nearly melting, juicy, subacid or with a peculiar sprightliness;
 quality good. Core large, closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube
 short, narrow, conical; seeds large, wide, long, acute.

Nearly a hundred years old without having received favorable mention
from pear growers, Lincoln has been brought from the limbo of lost
fruits in recent years to take high rank in the list of pears for the
Mississippi Valley. The variety is spoken of in such superlative terms
for that region that judging from its behavior in New York, it would
seem that western pear-growers give it attributes which Nature denies
it. At best, in the East, the fruits are but mediocre in appearance
and quality, falling below those of a dozen other varieties of the
same season whether judged by the eye or the palate. In Illinois and
Missouri, however, the fruits are spoken of as the handsomest and best.
These are not regions in which many good pears grow, since the cold of
winter, heat of summer, and pear-blight take toll from all but pears
of the strongest constitution. Lincoln seems to possess a constitution
to withstand these ills. At its best, the fruits of Lincoln seem
comparable to those of Bartlett, which the western admirers of the
variety say it resembles. In New York, comparisons of the fruits are
all in favor of Bartlett, as are the trees in all characters excepting
hardiness to heat and cold, and resistance to blight. The variety is
valuable only in the Middle West.

This pear had its origin in a seedling grown in the spring of 1835
by Mrs. Maria Fleming, Corwin, Illinois, The original tree proved to
be a vigorous grower as well as a heavy cropper, and was ultimately
given the name of Lincoln. Augustine and Company of Normal, Illinois,
propagated and distributed the variety about 1895. Young trees of the
variety appear to be vigorous growers, free from blight and of high
quality. The American Pomological Society added Lincoln to its list of
fruits in 1899.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, open-topped, hardy, very
 productive; trunk stocky, smooth; branches zigzag, greenish-brown,
 partly overspread with thin gray scarf-skin, marked on the younger
 wood with very numerous large, round lenticels; branchlets slender,
 very long, willowy, brownish-green overlaid with thin gray, dull,
 the new growth reddish-green, with numerous large, roundish, raised
 lenticels.

 Leaf-buds very small, short, pointed, appressed. Leaves 3-1/2 in.
 long, 1-1/2 in. wide, stiff; apex variable; margin glandless,
 finely serrate; petiole 2-5/8 in. long, glabrous, tinged with red;
 stipules very long and slender, pinkish. Flower-buds small, short,
 conical, free, singly on short spurs; flowers 1-3/8 in. across, well
 distributed, average 5 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1-1/8 in. long,
 slender, pubescent.

 Fruit matures in late August and September; medium in size, about
 2-1/4 in. in length and width, roundish, with an obtuse neck, tapering
 very slightly; stem 1-1/8 in. long, slender; cavity a slight, narrow
 depression, occasionally lipped; calyx large, open; lobes separated at
 the base, long, acuminate; basin shallow, obtuse, smooth, symmetrical;
 skin thick, tender, roughish; color yellow, sprinkled with few russet
 lines and nettings; dots numerous, small, russet, conspicuous; flesh
 tinged with yellow, firm, coarse and granular, tender, very juicy,
 sweet, aromatic, pleasing but not richly flavored; quality good. Core
 unusually large, closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short,
 wide, conical; seeds large, very wide, long, plump, acuminate.

The product of Lincoln Coreless is worthless for dessert, and but a
coarse makeshift for culinary purposes. The variety receives attention
only because the pear is a monstrosity and a curiosity. The fruits
are enormous in size, outweighing all other pears unless it be those
of the Pound. They are unique in having a very small core and few
or sometimes no seeds. They are further characterized by very late
maturity, ripening later than those of any other pear on the grounds
of this Station and keeping until April. While usually rather dull
greenish-yellow in color, the cheek is often enlivened by a bright
blush which makes the fruits rather attractive despite their grossness.
The catalogs describe the trees as "blight proof," but they blight on
the grounds of this Station. The variety is worth growing only as an
interesting curiosity.

According to William Parry, Parry, New Jersey, Lincoln Coreless
originated in Lincoln County, Tennessee, near the Alabama line, about
1830. The original tree was rated as productive and free from blight,
and young trees propagated from it have been unusually healthy and
vigorous. The variety was introduced about 1890 by William Parry.

 Tree small, vigorous, upright, very dense, pyramidal, hardy, an
 uncertain bearer; trunk shaggy; branches smooth, zigzag, reddish-brown
 mingled with ash-gray, marked with small lenticels; branchlets short
 to medium, dull brown, smooth, glabrous, with conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds large, obtuse, plump, appressed. Leaves 3 in. long, 1-5/8
 in. wide, elongated-oval, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin
 finely serrate; petiole 1-1/2 in. long, reddish; stipules very long.
 Flower-buds short, obtuse, plump, free; flowers 1-3/4 in. across, very
 large and showy, average 6 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1-5/8 in. long,
 thick, pubescent, pale green.

 Fruit ripe in February; very large, 4-3/4 in. long, 3 in. wide,
 uniform in size, obovate-acute-pyriform, somewhat ribbed, with unequal
 sides; stem 1-3/8 in. long, thick, curved; cavity obtuse, shallow,
 narrow, russeted, furrowed, often lipped; calyx open, large; lobes
 separated at the base, narrow, acute; basin very shallow, narrow,
 obtuse, furrowed; skin very thick, tough, coarse and granular, smooth,
 dull; color greenish-yellow, with a handsome blush on the cheek
 exposed to the sun; dots many, brownish-russet, very conspicuous;
 flesh yellowish-white, very firm, granular at the core, crisp, tough,
 medium juicy, rather bitter and astringent; quality poor. Core closed,
 with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube long, wide, conical; seeds few,
 narrow, often abortive, acute.

Now known in America as Louise, a name given it by the American
Pomological Society, this variety is described under the name given
it in England to distinguish it from at least eight other varieties
having Louise as the whole or a part of the name. The pear is an old
one, having many excellent qualities of fruit and tree, which, however,
are not sufficiently above the average to give it high place in the
list of pears for the market. The pears are medium to large, handsome,
of excellent quality, and keep and ship well. These qualities have
given it some preëminence as a pear for the export trade. The trees are
precariously hardy and somewhat subject to blight, but very vigorous,
productive, and long-lived. In Europe, the testimony of prominent
pomologists agrees that the fruits are better and the trees more
productive when worked on the quince, and in America the variety is
considered one of the best for dwarfing. This pear is a standard one
for home collections, and finds favor in many commercial orchards in
New York.

The parent tree of this pear was raised from seed about 1780 by M. de
Longueval, Avranches, Normandy. Some authorities say that the variety
was first named Bonne de Longueval; others, that M. de Longueval
immediately dedicated the pear to his wife and called it _Bonne Louise
de Longueval_. Later still, the Pomological Congress adopted the name
of _Bonne Louise d'Avranches_, by which it became more generally known,
though in England, it rather unfortunately became widely disseminated
as _Louise Bonne de Jersey_, having, presumably, found its way there
through the Channel Islands. The variety was brought to the United
States early in the nineteenth century, and in 1852 was entered in the
recommended list of fruits of the American Pomological Society. In
1897, this Society shortened the name to Louise.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright, very tall, dense-topped, hardy,
 productive, long-lived; trunk stocky; branches slightly zigzag,
 reddish-brown mingled with very dark grayish scarf-skin, with numerous
 raised lenticels; branchlets slender, long, dark reddish-brown, nearly
 smooth, glabrous, with few small, slightly raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds pointed, semi-free. Leaves 3-1/4 in. long, 1-3/4 in. wide,
 much curled under at the margins, oval, leathery; apex slightly
 taper-pointed; margin glandless, finely serrate; petiole 1-1/2 in.
 long, slender. Flower-buds small, conical or pointed, free; flowers
 with a disagreeable odor, 1-1/2 in. across, white or tinged with pink
 along the edge of the petals, averaging 6 buds in a cluster; pedicels
 1-1/2 in. long, slender, pubescent, light green.

 Fruit matures in October; medium to large, 2-7/8 in. long, 2-1/4 in.
 wide, uniform in size and shape, oblong-pyriform, somewhat irregular,
 with unequal sides; stem 1 in. long, slender, usually curved; cavity
 obtuse, very shallow and very narrow, furrowed and wrinkled, often
 lipped, the flesh folded up around the stem; calyx open, large; lobes
 broad, acute; basin obtuse, furrowed and uneven; skin granular,
 smooth; color pale yellow, marked on the exposed cheek with a dull red
 blush and with streaks of russet; dots numerous, small, grayish or
 russet, conspicuous; fruit yellowish-white, somewhat granular, tender
 and melting, very juicy, sweet and vinous, aromatic, rich; quality
 very good. Core closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short,
 wide, conical; seeds large, wide, long, plump, acute.

Why Lucy Duke is neglected is hard to see. Tree and fruit are highly
praised, Charles Downing thought the pear "not quite so fine as a
first-class Seckel, but I must aver it is not far behind." The pear
has a rich, juicy, spicy, melting flesh that makes it one of the best.
In form, the fruits resemble those of Bartlett, which is probably one
of the parents; they are of but medium size, but are of a beautiful
golden-russet color, which makes them as handsome as the handsomest.
The skin is thick and the pears stand shipping well. The variety can be
recommended for home and local markets, but the trees are a little too
unproductive and too irregular in bearing for commercial orchards. The
tree is hardy but only moderately vigorous and resembles Winter Nelis,
supposed to be the other parent, in habit of growth. The variety is
relatively free from blight.

Lucy Duke was grown about 1880 by Mrs. Lucy Duke, Beaufort County,
North Carolina, from seed of a Bartlett pear which she had received
from California, Its tree-characters are so nearly like those of Winter
Nelis that the other parent is supposed to be that variety. Lucy Duke
was introduced about 1892 by J. Van Lindley, Pomona, North Carolina.

 Tree medium to large, variable in vigor, upright becoming slightly
 spreading, dense-topped, hardy, productive; trunk shaggy; branches
 thick, zigzag, marked by numerous elongated lenticels; branchlets
 strongly curved, with short internodes, dark brownish-red mingled
 with green, mottled with scarf-skin, smooth, glabrous, with small,
 elongated or roundish, conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, pointed, plump, usually free; leaf-scars
 prominent. Leaves 3 in. long, 1-3/8 in. wide, thin; margin
 occasionally glandular, finely serrate or entire; petiole 1-1/2 in.
 long, slender. Flower-buds large, long, pointed, plump, free, singly
 on short spurs; flowers open late, with an unpleasant odor, 1-5/8 in.
 across; pedicels 1-1/8 in. long.

 acute-pyriform to oblong-pyriform, symmetrical; stem short, thick,
 curved; cavity obtuse, shallow, narrow, russeted, often wrinkled
 and occasionally lipped; calyx large, open, rounded and with a
 deeply-set center; basin obtuse, smooth, symmetrical; skin very tough,
 roughened with thick russet; color greenish-yellow, usually entirely
 overspread with solid, dark russet, changing to golden russet on
 the cheek exposed to the sun, with mottlings and flecks of russet;
 dots numerous, small, russet, obscure; flesh yellowish-white, fine,
 melting, rich, juicy, sweet; quality very good. Core large, closed,
 axile; calyx-tube short, wide, broadly conical; seeds large, wide,

Madeleine has long been a dependable summer variety, the crop of which
ripens just before that of Bloodgood. Many consider it the best very
early summer pear, and if the product alone were to be considered
it might well be called the best, but, unfortunately, the faults of
the trees more than offset the virtues of the fruits. The pears are
attractive in appearance, and very good in quality; but their season
is short, their skins are tender, and the flesh quickly softens at the
core. While the trees are productive, they are not resistant to blight,
do not hold their crop well, are tender to cold, and are short-lived.
The variety is worth planting only for the sake of succession in crop,
and in large collections of pears. The variety is recommended on the
Pacific slope for local markets.

The Madeleine pear is of ancient and somewhat uncertain origin. It was
cultivated by M. Le Lectier in his garden at Orléans in 1628, but
previously no other author had made mention of it, though M. Leroy,
writing in 1867, deemed it presumable that it had originated in France.
Besides its original names this pear has been known by some fifty
others in different localities and at different times, but Madeleine is
now its recognized name in this country. In England, it is known as the
_Citron des Carmes_. When and by whom it was introduced to America is
not clear, but it was a standard variety as early as 1831 when Prince
first described it. At the national convention of fruit-growers held in
1848, Madeleine was recommended for general cultivation, and ever since
this time the variety has appeared in the fruit-catalog of the American
Pomological Society.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright, open-topped, tender, productive; trunk
 shaggy; branches zigzag, light greenish-brown covered with gray
 scarf-skin; branchlets slender, long, reddish-brown mingled with
 green, mottled with ash-gray near the tips, smooth, glabrous, with
 small, raised, conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, very short, pointed, appressed. Leaves 3 in. long,
 1-1/2 in. wide, thin; apex taper-pointed; margin glandless, finely
 serrate; petiole 1-3/4 in. long, glabrous, reddish-green. Flower-buds
 small, thick, short, conical, plump, free, distributed as lateral buds
 or on very short spurs; flowers showy, 1-3/8 in. across, in dense
 clusters, average 11 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1-1/4 in. long,
 slightly pubescent.

 Fruit ripens in early August; inferior in size, 2-1/8 in. long, 2 in.
 wide, roundish-obtuse-pyriform; stem 1-1/2 in. long, thick, curved;
 cavity very shallow and narrow, or lacking, the flesh folded in a
 lip on one side of the stem; calyx partly open; lobes separated at
 the base, short, narrow, acuminate; basin shallow, narrow, obtuse,
 gently furrowed, symmetrical; skin thin, smooth, very tender; color
 dull green, occasionally with a faint, dotted, brownish blush; dots
 numerous, greenish, obscure; flesh slightly tinged yellow, granular
 at the center, tender and melting, very juicy, sweet, vinous; quality
 good to very good. Core closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube
 short, wide, conical; seeds wide, short, plump, acuminate.

The fruits of Margaret are early and attractive in color and shape.
This is about all that can be said for them, as they run small in size,
and in neither flesh nor flavor can they compete with the product of
several other varieties of the same season. The trees are hardly more
desirable than the fruits, since they are tender to cold, blight badly,
and are short-lived, seldom attaining full size. Despite these defects
of fruit and tree, the variety is a one-time favorite still rather
commonly planted. Better summer pears can be found for New York, and
for almost every part of the country.

In the middle of the nineteenth century, Christopher Wiegel, a German
nurseryman of Cleveland, Ohio, planted some seeds which he believed
to have been from a Seckel pear. Out of the trees grown from these he
selected two for further trial "because of their early coming into
bearing, their upright, vigorous habits of growth, profuse bearing, and
good quality of fruit." In 1866, Mr. Wiegel named one of these _Mary_
but later changed the name to Margaret.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, spreading, somewhat drooping,
 open-topped, productive; trunk shaggy; branches brown mingled with
 much red, overspread with thin gray scarf-skin, marked by numerous
 lenticels; branchlets slender, long, with long internodes, light
 reddish-brown, streaked with ash-gray scarf-skin, glossy, smooth,
 glabrous except on the newer growth, with numerous small, roundish,
 raised, conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, very short, pointed, appressed. Leaves 3 in. long,
 1-3/4 in. wide, thin; margin tipped with few pinkish glands, finely
 serrate; petiole 1-3/4 in. long, green; stipules of medium size.
 Flower-buds small, short, conical, pointed, free, singly on short
 spurs; flowers showy, 1-3/4 in. long, large, in dense clusters, 6 or 8
 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1-1/8 in. long, thick, pubescent.

 Fruit matures in late August and early September; medium in size,
 3 in. long, 2-3/4 in. wide, oblong-obovate-pyriform, irregular;
 stem 1-1/4 in. long, thick, curved; cavity acuminate, deep, narrow,
 russeted, furrowed and compressed, often with a pronounced lip; calyx
 open, large; lobes separated at the base, broad, acute, reflexed;
 basin deep, abrupt, furrowed, often compressed; skin thin, tender,
 smooth; color dull greenish-yellow, often with a deep but dull
 reddish-brown blush and occasional patches of russet; dots numerous,
 small, green or russet, obscure; flesh fine under the skin but
 granular and gritty near the center; tender, buttery, very juicy,
 faintly vinous, slightly aromatic; quality good. Core large, closed,
 with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube long, wide, funnel-shaped; seeds
 large, wide, plump, obtuse or acute.

The fruits of Marie Louise are among the perfections of Nature,
and were the tree more certain in bearing and less fastidious as
to environment and care, the variety would rank as one of the best
of all pears. Pomologists generally agree that its fruits are the
finest flavored of their season. The flesh is tender and melting,
very juicy, and the flavor is a most delectable commingling of
refreshing piquancy and scented sweetness. In shape, the pears resemble
those of Beurré Bosc, having the same trim contour, but the color
is very different--rich yellow, netted and sprinkled with russet,
and sun-flecked with red on the sunny side. The fruit is somewhat
susceptible to the scab fungus, and even the most careful spraying
fails to give it a fair cheek in some seasons. The trees are hardy
but only moderately vigorous, somewhat susceptible to blight, rather
uncertain in bearing, and vary much from season to season in abundance
and quality of product. Not at all suited for a commercial plantation,
Marie Louise is one of the choicest sorts for a home collection or in
the hands of a pear fancier.

The Abbé Duquesne, Mons, Belgium, raised this pear from seed in 1809
and dedicated it to Marie Louise, the second consort of Napoleon the
First. The Abbé passed the pear on to Van Mons, who in 1816 sent it
without a name to a Mr. Braddick of Thames Ditton, England, where
in time it became one of the best-known pears. Thomas Andrew Knight
sent cions of the variety from England to John Lowell, Roxbury,
Massachusetts, in 1823, whence it became widely disseminated in
America. The American Pomological Society placed Marie Louise in its
list of fruits in 1862.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, hardy,
 productive; trunk slender; branches dark reddish-brown mingled with
 thin gray scarf-skin, marked with many large lenticels; branchlets
 very slender and very short, with short internodes, light brown,
 tinged with brownish-red, glossy, smooth, glabrous, with very small,
 slightly raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, sharply pointed, plump, free. Leaves 2-1/2
 in. long, 1-1/4 in. wide, narrow, short, oval or somewhat elongated,
 leathery; apex obtusely or slightly taper-pointed; margin glandless,
 entire; petiole 2 in. long, greenish, glabrous, slender. Flower-buds
 small, conical, free, arranged singly as lateral buds or on short
 spurs; flowers very showy, 1-3/4 in. across, in dense clusters, 7 to
 9 buds in a cluster; pedicels often 1-1/8 in. long, slender, slightly
 pubescent, greenish.

 Fruit ripe in late September and early October; above medium in size,
 3-1/8 in. long, 2-5/16 in. wide, variable in size, oblong-pyriform,
 irregular, usually with sides unequal; stem 1-1/8 in. long, thick,
 curved; cavity very small and one-sided, russeted, often lipped;
 calyx large, open; lobes separated at the base, narrow, acuminate;
 basin obtuse, considerably furrowed; skin thin, tender, smooth, dull;
 color yellow, netted and sprinkled with russet especially on the
 exposed cheek; dots numerous, small, russet, somewhat obscure; flesh
 yellowish-white, granular, tender, buttery, very juicy, aromatic, with
 a rich, vinous flavor; quality very good. Core closed, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube short, narrow, conical; seeds wide, acute.

As a distinct type, and because the pears ripen at a season when there
are few other varieties of this fruit, Mount Vernon has a prominent
place in the list of worthy American pears. The top-shaped form and
reddish-russet color give the pear a unique appearance, and with
the greenish-yellow, granular, spicy, piquant flesh constitute very
distinct characters in its quality. Unfortunately, the russet color
is not well brought out in the accompanying color-plate. Lack of
uniformity in shape and size are the chief defects in the appearance
of the pears. The variety is valuable because it ripens its crop in
early winter from which time, under good conditions, it may be kept
until mid-winter, a season in which there are few good pears. The trees
are unusually satisfactory in most of the characters of importance in
a good pear-tree. The tree is vigorous but the head is small, with
numerous, short, stocky branches, many of which droop. The aspect given
the top by these peculiarities is quite distinct. The variety is worthy
when a winter pear is wanted whether for home or market.

This pear, which is very distinct from any other variety, originated
from a chance seedling in the garden of Samuel Walker, Roxbury,
Massachusetts, at the end of the first half of the nineteenth century.

 Tree large, vigorous, spreading, with many drooping branches,
 dense-topped, hardy, productive, long-lived; trunk stocky; branches
 thick, shaggy, reddish-brown, overcast with gray scarf-skin, marked
 by few large lenticels; branchlets thick, with short internodes,
 grayish-brown, smooth, glabrous, with a few large, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds variable in shape, usually free. Leaves 2-1/2 in. long,
 1-1/2 in. wide, oval, medium to thick, leathery; apex taper-pointed;
 margin crenate, tipped with rudimentary glands; petiole 1-1/4 in.
 long. Flower-buds large, long, conical or pointed, free; flowers 1-3/8
 in. across, in dense clusters, 7 to 9 buds in a cluster; pedicels 3/4
 in. long, slender, lightly pubescent, pale green, with a faint tinge
 of red.

 Fruit ripe in late October and November; medium in size, 2-1/2 in.
 long, 2-1/8 in. wide, uniform in size, roundish-obtuse-pyriform,
 irregular, with unequal sides, variable in shape; stem 1 in. long,
 thick, usually curved; cavity obtuse, very shallow and narrow,
 russeted, furrowed, often very heavily lipped, so that the stem
 appears to be inserted under a fleshy enlargement; calyx open; lobes
 short, narrow, acute to acuminate; basin narrow, obtuse, smooth,
 usually symmetrical; skin granular, roughened by russet, dull;
 color light russet overspreading a greenish-yellow ground, with a
 brownish-red blush on the exposed cheek, dotted and netted with
 russet; dots numerous, small, russet, obscure; flesh white, with
 a faint tinge of yellow, often with a green tinge under the skin,
 granular, tender and melting, juicy, sweet, aromatic, with a vinous
 tendency; quality good to very good. Core large, closed, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds variable in size,
 wide, long, plump, acute, many abortive.

This variety is rated in Europe as a delicious late-winter pear, and
the pomological writers of the last century give it all of the virtues
on this side of the Atlantic ascribed to it by Europeans. A closer
study of the variety as grown in America shows that it does not possess
the merits in this country given it by the French and English. The
quality of the pear as grown in New York is below that of several other
sorts of its season. The flesh is coarse and gritty and the flavor is
mediocre. The tree-characters are good, but are not sufficiently good
to offset the faults of the fruits.

Olivier de Serres was raised from seed of Fortunée about the middle
of the nineteenth century by M. Boisbunel, Rouen, France. It fruited
a few years later, but did not receive attention until about 1862.
At that time it was brought to the notice of the French Society of
Horticulture, and was pronounced a fruit of merit. At the suggestion
of M. Boisbunel, it was named after the illustrious Frenchman, Olivier
de Serres, who in France is called "The Father of Agriculture." It was
brought to America about 1865.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, dense-topped, upright-spreading,
 productive; trunk and branches marked with numerous lenticels;
 branchlets slender, short, curved, with short internodes, light
 reddish-brown, tinged with green, sprinkled with scattering,
 inconspicuous, very small, raised lenticels. Leaf-buds small, short,
 sharply pointed, free; leaf-scars with prominent shoulders. Leaves
 2-3/4 in. long, 1-1/4 in. wide; apex taper-pointed; margin glandular,
 finely serrate; petiole 2 in. long, slender. Flower-buds small,
 short, sharply pointed, free, singly on short spurs; flowers with an
 unpleasant odor, showy, 1-9/16 in. across; pedicels 1 in. long, thinly
 pubescent.

 Fruit ripens January to March; medium in size, 2-1/2 in. long, 2-3/4
 in. wide, roundish-obtuse-pyriform, truncate at both ends, irregular
 in outline; stem variable in length, averaging 3/4 in. long, thick,
 enlarged at the top, curved; cavity broad, slightly furrowed; calyx
 large, slightly open; basin variable in depth, furrowed; skin tender;
 color greenish-yellow, partly overspread with cinnamon-russet and
 sometimes with a dull blush on the exposed cheek; flesh whitish,
 variable in texture, juicy, varying from sweet to a brisk, vinous
 flavor; quality poor unless grown under the most favorable conditions.

Some seventy or eighty years ago this pear was widely introduced under
the names _Onondaga_ and _Swan's Orange_, and for a generation and
more was much grown in eastern pear regions. It has now practically
passed from cultivation in commercial orchards, but is still to
be found in collections and home plantings. The fruits are large,
handsome, and of very good quality, resembling those of Bartlett in
flavor and with even better flesh-characters. The trees are vigorous,
hardy, fruitful--almost ideal in every character but one. The tree is
so susceptible to blight that the variety can never have commercial
value in American orchards. Whether or not it is worth planting in home
orchards depends upon the planter's willingness to suffer loss from
blight.

It seems impossible to trace this variety to its ultimate source.
We know, however, that Henry Case, Liverpool, New York, cut a graft
during the winter of 1806 from a tree growing on land of a Mr. Curtiss
at Farmington, Connecticut. In the spring of the same year, Mr. Case
grafted this cion into a tree about three miles west of Onondaga Hill,
New York, and in 1808 moved the tree to Liverpool where it grew and
bore fruit. Many grafts were taken from this tree before it died in
1823. Up to this time, the variety appears to have received no name nor
had it been generally disseminated. We hear nothing further of it until
about 1840 when it was brought to notice by a Mr. Swan of Onondaga
Hollow, who exhibited specimens of the variety in Rochester. Ellwanger
and Barry were so impressed with the fruit that they secured cions and
propagated it under the name _Swan's Orange_ which they changed later
to _Onondaga_. Onondaga was given a place in the American Pomological
Society's fruit-catalog in 1858.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, spreading, open-topped, very
 productive; branches zigzag, reddish-brown, overspread with thin gray
 scarf-skin, marked with many large lenticels; branchlets slender,
 short, light brown, tinged with green and lightly streaked with
 ash-gray scarf-skin, dull, smooth, the new growth slightly pubescent,
 with small, raised, pinkish lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, sharply pointed, plump, free. Leaves 3-1/16
 in. long, 1-1/4 in. wide, narrow, oval, stiff, leathery; apex
 taper-pointed; margin coarsely but shallowly serrate, tipped with
 many reddish glands; petiole 1-7/8 in. long, light green mingled with
 red; stipules often lacking but when present very small, pale green.
 Flower-buds small, short, conical, plump, free, arranged singly on
 very short spurs; blossoms 1-1/8 in. across, in dense clusters, 7 to 8
 buds in a cluster; pedicels pubescent, greenish.

 Fruit ripe in early October; above medium to large, 2-3/4 in. long,
 2-1/2 in. wide, ovate or obovate-obtuse-pyriform, symmetrical, with
 unequal sides; stem 5/8 in. long, thick, curved; cavity a slight
 depression, with a fleshy enlargement at one side of the stem; calyx
 closed; lobes narrow, acute; basin narrow, obtuse, furrowed, uneven;
 skin granular, tender, smooth, dull; color pale yellow, with few lines
 of russet and with many russet spots; dots numerous, small, russet,
 conspicuous; flesh yellowish, granular both near the skin and at the
 center, melting, buttery, very juicy, aromatic, with a sweet, rich,
 vinous flavor; quality very good. Core large, closed, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube long, conical; seeds narrow, long, acute.

This variety was introduced nearly seventy years ago with the
expectation that the crop would follow that of Bartlett and be in as
great demand. While the variety did not come up to expectations, it
seems to have been too good to discard, and is to be found in many
collections in New York. The fruits are of the type of Bartlett, but
are smaller and usually lack the blush found on the fruits of Bartlett.
The trees are very satisfactory. The variety fails chiefly in the small
size of the fruits, although these are not as small as the rather poor
specimens illustrated in the accompanying plate, which were grown on
the grounds of this Station where the pears run below the average.

This variety was raised from seed of Canandaigua in the nurseries
of W. and T. Smith, Geneva, Ontario County, New York, and was first
introduced at the meeting of the American Pomological Society,
Rochester, New York, in 1856.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright, open-topped, hardy, productive; trunk
 stocky; branches thick, roughish, dull reddish-brown, overspread with
 dark ash-gray scarf-skin, marked by small lenticels; branchlets thick,
 very short, with short internodes, light brown mingled with green,
 smooth, glabrous, with small, raised, conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, pointed, free. Leaves 2 in. long, 1-1/2 in.
 wide, oval, thin, leathery, slightly curled under along the margins;
 apex abruptly pointed; margin glandular toward the apex, very finely
 serrate; petiole 1-1/2 in. long. Flower-buds small, short, conical or
 pointed, plump, free, singly or in small clusters on short branches or
 very short spurs; flowers 1-1/8 in. across, in a scattering raceme,
 from 8 to 10 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1-1/4 in. long, slender,
 pubescent, light green.

 Fruit in season from the middle to the last of September; medium in
 size, 2-1/2 in. long, 1-7/8 in. wide, uniform in size and shape,
 oblong-pyriform, with sides usually unequal; stem 3/4 in. long, thick;
 cavity obtuse, shallow, narrow, often russeted and lipped; calyx open;
 lobes separated at the base, narrow, acute; basin shallow to medium,
 obtuse, gently furrowed, sometimes compressed; skin smooth, dull;
 color pale yellow, with small patches and streaks of light-colored
 russet; dots numerous, very small, russet, obscure; flesh whitish,
 with a yellow tinge at the core, granular, firm but tender, juicy,
 sweet, slightly aromatic; quality good. Core closed, with clasping

The fruits of P. Barry are among the latest of all the pears grown on
the grounds of the New York Agricultural Experiment Station. They do
not ripen here until mid-winter and then keep until spring. A serious
defect is that they sometimes refuse to ripen but shrivel until decay
sets in late in the spring. To make certain that the pears ripen
properly, the fruit-room must not be too cold. The pears are excellent
in flavor, have good flesh-characters, and when properly ripened are
excelled in quality by no other winter pear. The variety should have a
place in the collection of every pear fancier to extend the season for
this fruit, and commercial pear growers might find it a profitable sort
for local market. Unfortunately, the trees are small, fastidious as to
environment, and somewhat uncertain in bearing.

Bernard S. Fox, San Jose, California, raised many pears from seed of
Belle Lucrative. Among these seedlings was one which fruited in 1873
and was named P. Barry, in honor of Patrick Barry,[31] an eminent
nurseryman and horticulturist of Rochester, New York. Of many scores
of seedlings raised by Mr. Fox only this one, Fox, and Colonel Wilder
were considered by the originator to be worthy of propagation. All
these received Wilder medals from the American Pomological Society in
1875 and 1881. In 1909, this Society added P. Barry to its catalog-list
of fruits.

Little known in America, this is one of the standard winter pears
in England. The fruits are exceedingly sugary, mildly spiced with
cinnamon, a flavor so unique, especially when compared with the piquant
flavor most common in winter pears, that the variety is worth growing
where it succeeds for the sake of diversity. The chief fault of the
variety is variability of product. On unsuitable soils and under
indifferent care, the pears are unattractive and poor in quality. The
accompanying illustration, it is to be feared, shows the variety at its
worst rather than at its best, since it does not thrive on the heavy,
cold clay of the Station lands. Under conditions at this Station, the
flesh is crisp and gritty, rather than buttery and fine as it seems
to be under more suitable conditions. The trees are very vigorous
on standard stocks and heavy soils, with the result that the fruits
are many but small and poor; checking vigor by dwarfing on quince or
planting on poor soil suits the variety. The trees are hardy and as
free as the average pear from blight. The variety is a good winter sort
for home or market.

This variety was raised in 1758 at Mons by the Abbé Hardenpont, the
Belgian priest and horticulturist. Extensively cultivated in Belgium,
it acquired a great diversity of names in different localities.
From that country it passed first to Germany toward the end of the
eighteenth century, and early in the nineteenth was taken to France.
Soon after the close of the Napoleonic wars, about 1817, it was
received in England. Within a few years after its introduction in
England, the variety found its way to America where, for a time, it was
quite extensively grown. The American Pomological Society added Passe
Colmar to its fruit-list in 1862 but dropped it in 1899.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright, tall, rapid-growing,
 productive; trunk slender; branches medium in thickness and
 smoothness, reddish-brown almost entirely overspread with thick, gray
 scarf-skin, marked by large, conspicuous lenticels; branchlets thick,
 long, light brown mingled with green, dull, smooth, pubescent only
 near the ends of the new growth, sprinkled with few small, raised,
 inconspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds short, plump, free, thick at the base; leaf-scars with
 prominent shoulders. Leaves 3 in. long, 1-1/2 in. wide, leathery;
 apex taper-pointed; margin tipped with few small glands, finely
 serrate to nearly entire; petiole 2 in. long, glabrous, pinkish-green.
 Flower-buds small, short, thick, conical, plump, free, singly as
 lateral buds or on very short spurs; flowers late, showy, 1-3/4 in.
 across, unusually large, in dense clusters, average 6 buds in a
 cluster; pedicels 3/4 in. long, thick, thinly pubescent.

 Fruit ripe December to January; medium in size, 2-1/2 in. long, 2-1/8
 in. wide, obovate-obtuse-pyriform, somewhat irregular; stem 1 in.
 long, very thick; cavity obtuse, shallow, narrow, russeted, slightly
 furrowed; calyx partly open; lobes separated at the base, rather
 narrow, acute; basin shallow, narrow, obtuse, gently furrowed; skin
 thick, granular, tender, roughish; color greenish-yellow, sprinkled
 with reddish-brown and russet patches and nettings; dots numerous,
 small, russet, obscure; flesh tinged with yellow, granular, tender,
 buttery, very juicy, sweet, vinous, aromatic; quality very good. Core
 large, closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide,
 conical; seeds large, wide, plump, acute.

Although this fine old English pear has more than ordinary merit, it
seems to be little grown in America. In appearance, the pears are
unsurpassed. The accompanying color-plate shows the shape and color
very well, but not the size, as, well grown, the pears are larger. From
the illustration, all must agree that the pears are handsome, fruits of
few other sorts being so alluring in shape and color. On warm soils or
in warm seasons, the flavor is choicely good giving the pears a rating
of "good to very good;" but in cold soils and seasons, the flavor is
often austere, or even acid and astringent. The season prolongs that
of Bartlett, and as the fruits are flavored very differently, being
more piquant and refreshing, and are ordinarily larger and handsomer,
Pitmaston ought to make a good market variety where it thrives. The
subacid flavor makes this one of the very best pears for culinary
purposes. Such reports as are at hand state that the fruits keep and
ship well. The variety seems not to have been grown widely in America,
so that one cannot speak with assurance of the tree-characters; but on
the grounds of this Station, the trees have fewer faults than those of
most of the standard varieties. They are hardy, vigorous, fairly immune
to blight, and while but moderately productive, bear annually, and the
large size of the fruits makes them high yielders. The variety should
be put on probation by those who grow for the markets, and is well
worthy a place in all home orchards.

Pitmaston was raised by John Williams at Pitmaston, near Worcester,
England, in 1841. It has been generally stated that it originated
from a cross between Duchesse d'Angoulême and Glou Morceau, although
an old gardener, who was employed by Mr. Williams, stated that there
was no record whatever of its parentage, but that it was the best of
a number of seedlings. For some time it was known as the _Pitmaston
Duchesse d'Angoulême_ on account of the theory of its derivation in
part from the Duchesse d'Angoulême; but in 1870 its name was simplified
in England to _Pitmaston Duchess_. In 1874 it obtained a first-class
certificate from the Royal Horticultural Society, England. In this
country it was first fruited by John Saul, Washington, District of
Columbia, in 1870, and was noted and illustrated by Elliott in the
_Rural New Yorker_ under the name _Pitmaston Duchesse d'Angoulême_.
Although favorably mentioned several times by the American Pomological
Society, the variety has never received a place in the Society's
fruit-catalog.

 Tree large, vigorous, spreading, dense-topped, moderately productive;
 trunk stocky, shaggy; branches thick, slightly zigzag, reddish-brown,
 overlaid with very dark grayish scarf-skin, marked with numerous
 large lenticels; branchlets long, dull, dark reddish-brown, roughish,
 glabrous, with numerous small, raised, conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds short, obtuse, appressed; leaf-scars prominent. Leaves 2-1/2
 in. long, 1-1/2 in. wide, leathery; apex abruptly pointed; margin
 finely serrate; petiole 1-3/4 in. long. Flower-buds short, conical,
 pointed, free; flowers showy, 1-3/4 in. across, well distributed,
 average 7 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1 in. long, pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in October; large, 3-3/4 in. long, 3 in. wide,
 oblong-obovate-pyriform, symmetrical; stem 1 in. long, thick, often
 curved; cavity very shallow and very narrow, or lacking, the flesh
 drawn up in a wrinkled fold around the base of the stem, often lipped;
 calyx closed, large; lobes long, broad, acute; basin shallow, obtuse,
 furrowed and wrinkled; skin thin, granular, smooth, tender, dull;
 color pale lemon-yellow, dotted and somewhat patched with light russet
 especially around the stem, without blush; dots numerous, small,
 russet, conspicuous; flesh tinged with yellow, somewhat granular,
 melting, buttery, very juicy, piquant and vinous; quality good to very
 good. Core large, closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short,
 wide, conical; seeds narrow, long, flat, acute, very often abortive.

Pound is grown in collections for its monstrous fruits, which have few
virtues other than large size. The pears not infrequently weigh three
pounds, and one is noted in the next paragraph weighing four pounds,
nine ounces. The pears are coarse in form, texture and flavor--but one
degree better in flavor than the potato-like fruits of Kieffer and even
more sappy. The pears keep well and are said to be fairly good for
culinary purposes. The trees are unusually satisfactory, because of
which the variety should make a good parent from which to breed.

The name "Pound" has been applied to a number of varieties, notably
Black Worcester, Angora, Verulam, and others. The variety now known as
Pound in America is more generally known in Europe as _Belle Angevine_
or _Uvedale's St. Germain_. This sort appears to have been raised by a
Dr. Uvedale, who was a schoolmaster at Eltham, England, in 1690. Miller
in his Dictionary, in 1724, speaks of him as a Dr. Udal of Enfield,
"a curious collector and introducer of many rare exotics, plants and
flowers," and Bradley, in 1733, speaks of the pear as "Dr. Udale's
great pear, called by some the _Union_ pear." William Robert Prince
mentions the Pound pear in 1831 saying that "it often weighs from
twenty-five to thirty ounces, and one was exhibited in New Jersey about
four years since, weighing forty and a half ounces." In 1870, according
to Wickson, a Pound pear sent from Sacramento to the late Marshall P.
Wilder, President of the American Pomological Society, weighed four
pounds and nine ounces. In 1862, the American Pomological Society
added this variety to its fruit-catalog under the name _Uvedale's St.
Germain_, but in 1871 changed the name to Pound. The name continued to
appear in the Society's catalogs until 1909 when it was dropped.

 Tree medium in size, upright, dense-topped, hardy, very productive;
 trunk stocky, shaggy; branches thick, shaggy, zigzag, dull
 reddish-brown, heavily covered with gray scarf-skin, marked with
 many large lenticels; branchlets short, with short internodes,
 brownish-red, mottled with gray scarf-skin, smooth, glabrous, with few
 small, elongated lenticels.

 Leaf-buds large, long, conical or pointed, plump, free; leaf-scars
 prominent. Leaves 4-1/4 in. long, 3-3/4 in. wide, ovate, thin, stiff;
 apex taper-pointed; margin glandular, finely serrate; petiole 1-3/4
 in. long, slender. Flower-buds large, long, conical or pointed, very
 plump, free, usually singly on short spurs; flowers open early, 1-3/8
 in. across, large, well distributed, average 7 buds in a cluster;
 pedicels 1-1/2 in. long, pubescent, pale green.

 Fruit matures in February; large, 4 in. long, 2-7/8 in. wide, uniform
 in size and shape, obovate-acute-pyriform, with unequal sides; stem
 long, thick, curved; cavity obtuse, very shallow, narrow, russeted,
 furrowed, drawn up in a fleshy ring about the stem; calyx large, open;
 lobes separated at the base, obtuse; basin shallow, narrow, obtuse,
 slightly furrowed, symmetrical; skin thick, tough, with patches of
 russet, dull, roughened by the dots and by the russet markings;
 color golden-yellow, often marked on the exposed cheek with a bronze
 or pinkish blush; dots numerous, russet, very conspicuous; flesh
 yellowish, firm, granular, very tough, subacid, inferior in flavor;
 quality very poor. Core large, closed, axile, with meeting core-lines;
 calyx-tube short, wide, conical; carpels pear-shaped; seeds very
 large, brownish-black, wide, long, acuminate.

Président Drouard has been on probation in the United States for nearly
thirty years, but does not seem to be in great demand in any part of
the country. In the pear-growing region of New York to which it first
came, it is scarcely known. The accompanying description shows that
the fruits contain all of the requisites of a good pear. The flesh is
juicy, melting, saccharine, rich, and perfumed. The trees, however,
are not satisfactory. They lack vigor, blight badly, and are niggardly
in bearing. With these faults, there is no place for the variety in
commercial plantations, but it may well be planted in home orchards and
in collections.

Président Drouard is a chance seedling found in the suburbs of
Pont-de-Ce, Maine-et-Loire, France, by M. Olivier, gardener at the
Fruit-Garden at Angers. It was sent out by M. Louis Leroy of Angers and
was described in 1886 as a new pear. It seems to have been introduced
in this country by Charles A. Green, Rochester, New York. The American
Pomological Society added the variety to its list of fruits under the
name _Drouard_ in 1899.

 Tree of medium size, spreading, open-topped, usually hardy; branches
 reddish-brown, nearly covered with gray scarf-skin, marked with
 small lenticels; branchlets thick, long, greenish-brown mingled with
 red, dull, smooth, pubescent on the new growth, with numerous small,
 brownish, raised, conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, pointed, plump, free; leaf-scars with very
 prominent shoulders; Leaves 3 in. long, 1-3/4 in. wide, oval, thick,
 leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin glandless or with but few
 glands, entire or closely serrate; petiole glabrous, greenish, thick,
 1-5/8 in. long, tinged red; stipules very short, tinged with pink.
 Flower-buds short, conical, very plump, free, arranged singly on short
 spurs; flowers 1-3/8 in. across, in dense clusters, 6 to 9 buds in a
 cluster; pedicels 1-1/8 in. long, lightly pubscent, greenish.

 Fruit in season from late November to December; large, 3-1/2 in. long,
 3 in. wide, oblong-obovate-pyriform, with unequal sides, uniform
 in shape; stem 1 in. long, very thick and woody; cavity obtuse,
 deep, irregular, furrowed, usually lipped; calyx large, open; lobes
 separated at the base, long, narrow, acuminate; basin deep, abrupt,
 usually smooth but sometimes gently furrowed; skin thick, tough,
 rough, dull; color clear lemon-yellow, with nettings and streaks of
 russet; dots numerous, small, russet, obscure; flesh tinged with
 yellow, very granular at the core, tender and melting, buttery,
 juicy, aromatic, sweet; quality good. Core large, closed, axile, with
 clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds large,
 wide, long, plump, acute, occasionally abortive.

Reeder is another of the pears too good to discard, and not quite good
enough to give an ardent recommendation. In quality, the fruits rank
but little below those of Seckel; are about the same size as grown
under average conditions; but are even duller and less attractive in
color than the modest fruits of Seckel, which is probably one of its
parents. The fruits have a place in the home and markets as a pear to
follow Seckel, the crop coming in season just after that of Seckel
passes out. The trees do poorly in the nursery, as they make but a
short, slender growth until well established in the orchard, after
which they become of medium size but very vigorous. The branches
droop as do those of Winter Nelis, the other parent, although not
so markedly. The variety is as nearly blight-proof as either of its
parents.

Reeder is a seedling raised about 1855 by Dr. Henry Reeder, Varick, New
York, from seed of Winter Nelis. The parent tree stood near a Seckel
and it is considered that Reeder is a cross between the two varieties.
The American Pomological Society added the variety to its fruit-catalog
in 1871 under the name _Doctor Reeder_, but in 1883 changed the name to
Reeder.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, spreading, drooping, open-topped,
 productive; branches zigzag, reddish-brown partly overspread with gray
 scarf-skin, sprinkled with numerous lenticels; branchlets slender,
 willowy, long, reddish-brown mingled with gray, the new growth
 reddish-green, dull, smooth, glabrous except near the tips of the new
 growth, with few very small, inconspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, pointed, appressed. Leaves 2-3/4 in. long,
 1-1/4 in. wide, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin crenate to nearly
 entire; petiole 2 in. long, tinged with red; stipules few, very small,
 reddish-green. Flower-buds small, short, conical, free, singly on
 short spurs; flowers 1-1/4 in. across, in dense clusters, average 9
 buds in a cluster; pedicels 3/4 in. long, slender.

 Fruit ripe in October and November; small, 1-3/4 in. long, 1-7/8 in.
 wide, globular-obtuse-pyriform, slightly ribbed and irregular; stem
 1-1/4 in. long, slender, curved; cavity a very small depression in
 which is inserted the base of the stem, symmetrical; calyx large,
 open; lobes separated at the base, long, narrow, reflexed, acuminate;
 basin very shallow and narrow, smooth; skin thick, smooth, tender;
 color dull greenish-yellow, mottled and streaked with russet, blushed
 faintly on the exposed cheek with brownish-red; dots few, small,
 obscure, greenish or russet; flesh white, granular toward the center
 but fine-grained near the skin, tender, somewhat stringy, very juicy,
 aromatic; quality good. Core large, closed, with clasping core-lines;
 calyx-tube long, narrow, funnel-shaped; seeds unusually large, wide,
 long, plump, acute.


[Illustration: RIEHL BEST]

                              RIEHL BEST

 =1.= Stark Bros. _Cat._ 18. 1912. =2.= _Ibid._ 55. 1916.

Riehl Best is described among the major varieties because it is as
nearly blight-proof as any other European pear. It might well be
tried in localities where standard sorts cannot be raised because of
blight, and is worth growing in breeding work as a parent to obtain
blight-resistant varieties. The pears are rather unattractive in
appearance, but are excellent in quality. The flesh is juicy, tender,
vinous, free from grittiness and seldom rots at the core. The trees,
besides being nearly free from blight, are hardy to heat and cold, and
bear annually. The fruits fall far short of those of standard varieties
in New York.

This pear was discovered by Edwin H. Riehl, Godfrey, Illinois, and was
introduced by Stark Brothers, Louisiana, Missouri. Mr. Riehl says: "The
farm on which the original tree stood was owned by a pioneer nurseryman
who evidently imported from France a number of varieties, some perhaps
without name. Riehl Best trees and several hundreds of other varieties
represent the remains of three old orchards planted fifty years ago.
Trees of other varieties are ruined by blight while Riehl Best is
in perfect health and bears every season." From this history it is
probable that Riehl Best is an old European pear renamed.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright, dense-topped, rapid-growing,
 productive; trunk stocky; branches thick, light reddish-brown,
 overspread with thin scarf-skin, marked with large, conspicuous,
 numerous lenticels; branchlets slender, often willowy, long,
 greenish-brown, dull, smooth, pubescent only near the ends of the new
 growth, sprinkled with small, slightly raised, inconspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, pointed, plump, free; leaf-scars with
 prominent shoulders. Leaves 3 in. long, 1-3/4 in. wide, thick; apex
 abruptly pointed; margin glandless, variable in serrations; petiole 2
 in. long. Flower-buds small, short, conical, plump, free, singly on
 short spurs; flowers 1-5/8 in. across, in dense clusters, average 6
 buds in a cluster; pedicels 7/8 in. long, lightly pubescent.

This variety is still on probation in America, with the chances
strongly against it proving worthy to bear the name of the man after
whom it was called. On the grounds of the New York Agricultural
Experiment Station, the fruits are too small, too poorly colored, and
too poor in quality to compete with those of a score of other sorts
of the same season. The core is remarkably small, and the seeds are
few and small, but these are insufficient merits to count against the
several defects named. The tree is robust and generally satisfactory.
The variety may not be at its best on the grounds of this Station, as
in Europe it was heralded as a most remarkable sort--one "destined to
bring about a revolution in pear-growing." It may be worth further
trial in New York.

This pear was introduced in 1905 by the noted French pomologist Charles
Baltet, Troyes, France, after he had tested it for several years.
He named it after President Roosevelt. The variety was approved at
Horticultural Congresses in Paris, Lyons, and Orléans, as well as by
the Royal Horticultural Society of London. It was received in America
shortly after its dissemination in France.

 Tree medium to large, vigorous, very upright, dense-topped,
 rapid-growing, productive; trunk slender, smooth; branches slender,
 smooth, glossy reddish-brown, mottled and overlaid with gray
 scarf-skin, marked with numerous small, raised lenticels; branchlets
 characteristically thick, with blunt ends, long, with short
 internodes, dull reddish-brown mingled with gray scarf-skin, smooth,
 glabrous, with many large, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds long, conical, sharply pointed, plump, free; leaf-scars with
 prominent shoulders. Leaves 3 in. long, 1-3/8 in. wide, stiff; apex
 taper-pointed; margin usually glandless, finely serrate to almost
 entire; petiole 2 in. long, slender, curved. Flower-buds large,
 long, conical, pointed, free, singly on short spurs; flowers with a
 disagreeable odor, early, showy, 1-5/8 in. across, in dense clusters,
 average 7 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1-1/8 in. long, thick, pubescent.

 Fruit ripens in late September and October; medium in size, about
 2-7/16 in. in length and width, roundish-obtuse-pyriform, symmetrical;
 stem 1 in. long, thick; cavity very shallow, or lacking, faintly
 lipped; calyx very open, large; lobes separated at the base, narrow,
 acute; basin shallow, wide, obtuse, smooth, symmetrical; skin
 unusually thick, tough, smooth, dull; color pale lemon-yellow, mottled
 and netted with russet, with a faint blush; dots numerous, small,
 light russet, obscure; flesh light salmon, fine-grained except at
 the center which is granular, tender and melting, very juicy, mildly
 sweet, without much character; quality medium. Core small, closed,
 axile, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube long, very wide, conical;
 carpels cordate; seeds wide, acute.

Rutter does not seem to have made a very high place for itself in the
country at large, but about Geneva, New York, it is a most excellent
late autumn variety. The pears are good or very good in quality,
rather attractive, keep well, ship well, and sell well to those who
know the variety. The trees have a combination of good characters
that commend them most highly. Thus, they are comparatively immune to
blight, enormously productive, bear early, grow rapidly, live long, and
are hardy. The fruits hang exceptionally well to the trees, so that
the variety is a valuable one for exposed situations. Rutter can be
recommended for both home and market plantations.

This variety was raised by John Rutter, West Chester, Pennsylvania,
from seed of Léon Leclerc (Van Mons) about sixty years ago. It was
approved by the Committee on New Native Fruits of the American
Pomological Society in 1867. This Society placed the variety on its
list of recommended fruits in 1869.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright, dense-topped, rapid-growing,
 productive; trunk stocky; branches thick, reddish-brown, covered
 with gray scarf-skin, sprinkled with very conspicuous lenticels;
 branchlets long, light brown mingled with green and streaked with
 ash-gray scarf-skin, smooth, glabrous, with small, conspicuous, raised
 lenticels.

 Leaf-buds long, conical, pointed, plump, free. Leaves 3-3/8 in. long,
 1-5/8 in. wide, thick, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin nearly
 glandless, almost entire; petiole 2 in. long, glabrous, reddish-green.
 Flower-buds medium in size and length, conical, plump, free, singly on
 short spurs; flowers very showy, 1-3/8 in. across, almost in racemes,
 6 or 8 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1-1/4 in. long, pubescent.

 Fruit matures in late October and early November; large, 3-1/8 in.
 long, 3 in. wide, roundish-obtuse-pyriform, with a very thick, blunt
 neck, with unequal sides; stem 3/4 in. long, thick, woody; cavity
 acuminate, unusually large, deep, russeted, occasionally furrowed and
 wrinkled, slightly lipped; calyx small, open; lobes separated at the
 base, short, narrow, acute; basin deep, obtuse, smooth, symmetrical;
 skin thick, gritty, roughish, dull; color yellow, overspread with
 light russet, mottled and flecked with russet; dots numerous, small,
 russet, conspicuous; flesh whitish, granular at the center, tender and
 melting, juicy, aromatic, sweet but refreshing; quality good to very
 good. Core small, closed, abaxile, with meeting core-lines; calyx-tube
 long, conical; seeds small, roundish, plump, obtuse.

Seckel is an American pear distinct in type from any European variety.
Among the several hundred pears that are grown on this side of the
Atlantic, Seckel stands almost alone in vigor of tree, productiveness,
and immunity to blight, and is equalled by no other variety in high
quality of fruit. If the fruits were larger, Seckel would challenge
the world as a pear for the markets as it now does as a pear for the
home orchard. After Bartlett and the disreputable Kieffer, it is now
more grown than any other variety in America, everywhere being used as
the standard for excellence. The fruits are small, not highly colored,
but attractive because clean and trim in contour. But it is the
flesh-characters that give the fruits their high standing. The flesh is
melting, juicy, perfumed and most exquisitely and delicately flavored,
with the curious character of having much of its spicy, aromatic
flavor in the skin, which should never be discarded in eating. The
reddish-brown color of the fruit is another distinguishing character
of Seckel. Unlike most other dessert pears, the fruits of this one are
excellent for culinary purposes. Still another distinctive character
is that the fruits do not lose much in quality by ripening on the
tree. Besides being nearly iron-clad in resistance to blight and very
productive, the trees are almost as hardy as those of any other pear,
and are remarkable for their large, low, compact, broadly pyramidal
tops. The tree is further distinguished by its short-jointed, stout,
olive-colored wood, and its habit of bearing fruits in clusters on the
ends of the branches. The trees do best in fertile soils which must
not be a heavy clay. Its blossoms are markedly self-fertile. There
are several faults of fruit and tree. The fruits are small and do not
keep after maturity; it costs twice as much to pick them as it does
the large-fruited Bartlett; fruit and foliage are susceptible to scab;
the pears are too small for commercial canning; and the trees are late
in coming in bearing. With these several faults, however, Seckel is
usually a profitable commercial variety as a well-grown crop almost
always commands a fancy price. For the home orchard, Seckel has no
rival in any part of North America where European varieties are grown.

Toward the close of the eighteenth century, there lived in Philadelphia
a well-known sportsman and cattle dealer known as "Dutch Jacob."
Every autumn, upon returning from shooting excursions, Dutch Jacob
distributed among his neighbors pears of exceedingly delicious flavor.
The place of their growth he kept secret. In time, a tract of land
south of Philadelphia was disposed of in parcels, and Dutch Jacob
secured the ground on which his favorite pear tree stood, a neck of
land near the Delaware river. Shortly afterwards this land became the
property of a Mr. Seckel, who gave the pear his name and introduced
it. Later, the property was added to the estate of Stephen Girard,
and the original tree long remained vigorous and fruitful. The new
variety was soon widely disseminated and everywhere became popular.
As early as 1819, Dr. Hossack of New York sent trees of the variety
to the London Horticultural Society, whence it was later distributed
in England. There is much difference of opinion as to the spelling of
the name of this pear. Coxe, who lived in Philadelphia and probably
knew the introducer of the pear, writing in 1817, spelled the name
_Seckle_. English pomologists have followed Coxe. Nearly all of Coxe's
contemporaries, however, spelled it _Seckel_, the spelling now in
common use. At the first meeting of the American Pomological Society,
held in 1848, Seckel was recommended for general cultivation and the
variety has ever held its place among the pears recommended by the
Society.

 Tree large and very vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped, hardy,
 very productive, long-lived; trunk very stocky; branches thick,
 reddish-brown mingled with dull gray scarf-skin, covered with small
 lenticels; branchlets thick, long, dark reddish-brown, dull, smooth,
 glabrous, with small, slightly raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, obtuse or pointed, appressed; leaf-scars
 prominent. Leaves 2-1/2 in. long, 1-1/2 in. wide, oval, leathery;
 apex taper-pointed; margin finely serrate; petiole 1-1/2 in. long;
 stipules very long when present. Flower-buds small, short, conical,
 free; flowers 1-1/4 in. across, in dense clusters, 7 or 8 buds in a
 cluster; pedicels 5/8 in. long, slender, lightly pubescent, light
 green, slightly streaked with red.

 Fruit ripe in October; small, 2-1/4 in. long, 2 in. wide, uniform
 in size and shape, obovate, symmetrical; stem 1/2 in. long, short,
 thick, often curved; cavity obtuse, with a very shallow, narrow
 depression, symmetrical; calyx small, partly open; lobes separated
 at the base, short, variable in width, acute; basin very shallow
 and narrow, strongly obtuse, symmetrical; skin smooth, dull; color
 yellowish-brown, lightly marked with pale russet and often with a
 lively russet-red cheek; dots numerous, very small, russet or grayish;
 flesh white, with a faint tinge of yellow, slightly granular, melting,
 buttery, very juicy; sweet, with an exceedingly rich, aromatic, spicy
 flavor; quality very good to best. Core small, closed, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube short, conical; seeds small, short, not very
 plump, obtuse.

Were the fruits alone to be considered, Sheldon would take rank as
one of the best of all pears. The fruits please both the eye and the
palate. Those of no rival in season surpass them either in appearance
or in characters that satisfy taste. While not large, the fruits are of
sufficient size to meet the demands of a good dessert pear. The shape
is a perfect turbinate, truncated at the base of the fruit, usually
very symmetrical, and the fruits run uniform in shape. In color, the
pears are distinctive in their russeted skin, with a handsome ruddy
cheek. The accompanying color-plate does not do justice to the fruit
in illustrating size, shape, or color. The flesh is melting and juicy,
and deserves, more than that of almost any other pear, the adjective
luscious. The flavor is sweet, vinous, and highly perfumed. The
fruits keep well, ship well, and sell well during their season, and
are esteemed both for dessert and for culinary purposes. The list of
faults in the trees is as long as the list of virtues in the fruits.
The trees, while large, vigorous, and hardy, blight as badly as any
pear-tree in the orchard, are reluctant in coming in bearing, niggardly
in production, and seldom hold their crop well. With these faults of
the tree, Sheldon is not a commercial variety of high rank, but the
splendid fruits make it worth growing by the pear-fancier, in the home
orchard, or for the markets where the faults of the trees are not too
marked. The variety grows better in New York, possibly, than in any
other part of the United States.

This pear is a native of the town of Huron, New York. The original tree
stood on the premises of Major Sheldon, having sprung from seed brought
by his father from Washington, New York, about 1815. The fruit was
first exhibited at the Pomological Convention in Syracuse in the autumn
of 1849. In 1854, Sheldon was mentioned by the American Pomological
Society as promising well, and in 1856 it was given a place in the
Society's fruit-catalog.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, rapid-growing, hardy,
 moderately productive; trunk stocky; branches thick, reddish-brown,
 overlaid with dull gray scarf-skin, marked with large lenticels;
 branches thick, dull brown, glabrous, with numerous slightly raised,
 conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds large, above medium in length, obtuse or somewhat pointed,
 appressed. Leaves 2-1/2 in. long, 1-1/4 in. wide, oval, leathery;
 apex taper-pointed; margin finely serrate; petiole 1-1/2 in. long.
 Flower-buds conical or pointed, free; flowers 1-1/8 in. across, in
 dense clusters, 13 or 14 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1/2 in. long,
 thick, pubescent, greenish.

 Fruit matures in October; large, 2-3/4 in. long, 2-1/2 in. wide,
 uniform in size and shape, turbinate, often with a tendency to
 oblateness, symmetrical; stem 3/4 in. long, thick, nearly straight;
 cavity obtuse, deep, slightly furrowed, occasionally lipped;
 calyx large, open; lobes very broad, obtuse; basin wide, obtuse,
 symmetrical; skin thick, granular, tender, roughish; color dull
 greenish-yellow, with a brownish-red blush, overspread with russet
 nettings and streaks; dots numerous, small, russet; flesh whitish,
 somewhat granular, tender and melting, very juicy, sweet, and vinous,
 with a rich and pleasantly aromatic flavor; quality very good to best.
 Core large, closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide,
 conical; seeds acute.

Very similar to Clapp Favorite and Bartlett, and not as good as either
in fruit-characters, Souvenir du Congrès hardly merits a place in
American pomology. The crop ripens between those of the two sorts
with which it has been compared, and the fruits are larger and often
handsomer. The fruits are said to be larger and of better quality when
the tree is double-worked on the quince. The tree is remarkable for
vigor, hardihood to cold, and healthfulness; and bears so abundantly
that the crop must be thinned to prevent breaking of branches. The
variety grows especially well in New York, and is deserving a place in
home orchards and in fruit-collections. The accompanying color-plate
illustrates the size, shape, and color of this pear remarkably well.

Souvenir du Congrès owes its origin to M. François Morel, Lyons,
France. M. Morel grafted one of his pear-trees with cions taken from
several other varieties, including Bartlett, and from the tree thus
grafted he obtained fruit, seeds of which he sowed in 1852. One of the
resultant trees bore fruit in 1863, and the pears had so many earmarks
of Bartlett that it was at once assumed to be a seedling of that
variety. The tree continued to do well and in due course the variety
was judged to be worthy of dissemination by the Rhône Horticultural
Society. Later, M. Morel dedicated the new pear to the Pomological
Congress of France. The variety was introduced in the United States
about 1870. The American Pomological Society placed Souvenir du
Congrès on its fruit-catalog list in 1875.

 Tree medium in size and vigor, upright-spreading, open-topped, very
 productive; branches zigzag, dull reddish-brown, heavily overspread
 with ash-gray scarf-skin, marked by small, raised lenticels;
 branchlets thick, long, reddish-brown, overspread with dull gray
 mingled with green, smooth, glabrous, with few small, slightly raised
 lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, pointed, plump, free. Leaves 1-7/8 in. long,
 1-1/2 in. wide, roundish-oval, leathery; apex abruptly pointed; margin
 tipped with very few glands, finely serrate; petiole 1-1/2 in. long,
 glabrous, tinged with red. Flower-buds short, conical or pointed,
 plump, free, arranged singly on very short spurs or branchlets;
 flowers with a disagreeable odor, 1-1/8 in. across, pinkish-white as
 the buds unfold, becoming whitish, in dense clusters, 6 to 8 buds in a
 cluster; pedicels 3/4 in. long, thick, heavily pubescent, light green.

 Fruit ripe in September; large, 3-7/16 in. long, 2-11/16 in. wide,
 uniform in size and shape, oblong-acute-pyriform, symmetrical, with
 unequal sides; stem 1 in. long, short, thick, curved; cavity obtuse,
 almost lacking, very shallow, narrow, russeted, slightly furrowed,
 often with the stem inserted beneath a pronounced irregular lip; calyx
 open; lobes separated at the base, narrow, acute; basin wide, obtuse
 and flaring, slightly furrowed, symmetrical, smooth except for the
 thick, russet covering; color yellow, with a reddish blush on the
 exposed cheek, covered with nettings of russet and yellow patches;
 dots numerous, small, russet, conspicuous; flesh white, with a faint
 tinge of yellow, firm, granular, tender, very juicy, sweet, with a
 musky flavor; quality good. Core closed, with clasping core-lines;
 calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds large, wide, plump, acute.

Downing, in 1869, noted this old French pear as one of the best for
either amateur or commercial grower, and at that time it was rather
widely planted. Now, however, growers seldom set it. The trees are
vigorous, hardy, healthy, and productive, and the fruits are attractive
in appearance and rather good in quality, but neither tree nor fruit
rise much above mediocrity, and the variety has no outstanding
character to give it individuality. The crop comes in season in
December, the pears keeping well until ripe, after which they quickly
decay. The variety is worth planting only for the sake of diversity.

Major Espéren, Mechlin, Belgium, raised this pear from seed about the
middle of the nineteenth century. The name _Souvenir d'Espéren_ was
at one time applied to _Fondante de Noël_ in consequence of which
confusion has existed as to the identity of the two sorts. The pear
reached America about 1850.

 Tree medium in size, upright, slightly spreading, dense-topped,
 productive; branches reddish-brown overlaid with thin scarf-skin,
 marked with very conspicuous but scattering lenticels; branchlets very
 thick and long, with long internodes, light brown mingled with green,
 dull, glabrous, sprinkled with small, conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds very small, short, pointed, plump, free. Leaves 3 in. long,
 1-5/8 in. wide; apex abruptly pointed; margin uneven, finely serrate;
 petiole 2-5/8 in. long, tinged red. Flower-buds small, short, conical,
 plump, free, singly on very short spurs; flowers open late, showy,
 1-3/8 in. across, average 7 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1-1/4 in.
 long, slender.

 Fruit ripe the last of November and December; large, 3-1/2 in. long,
 2-5/8 in. wide, oblong-obovate-pyriform, the surface uneven; stem
 1-1/4 in. long, slender; cavity very obtuse and shallow or lacking,
 the flesh drawn up about the base of the stem in a lip; calyx partly
 open, small; lobes separated at the base, short, narrow, acute; basin
 shallow, narrow, obtuse, wrinkled; skin thick, roughened with russet;
 color greenish-yellow, mottled and patched with russet, sprinkled with
 many russet dots and often with russet overspreading nearly the entire
 surface; dots numerous, russet, small; flesh yellowish, very granular
 near the center, firm, crisp but tender, juicy, with a pleasant,
 aromatic, vinous flavor; quality good to very good. Core large,
 closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical;
 seeds small, short, plump, acute, light brown.

Sudduth has little to recommend it for New York or eastern pear
regions, but it is a standard sort in parts of the Mississippi Valley.
The characters which give it a place in the pear flora of the region
just named are remarkable freedom from blight, hardiness to cold
and heat, capacity to withstand drought, early bearing, and great
productiveness. The fruits are neither attractive in appearance nor
high in quality--hardly fit for dessert, being but a grade or two
better than the disreputable Kieffer. Like those of the Kieffer,
however, the fruits do very well for all culinary purposes. They do not
keep well as they soften at the center soon after becoming edible. The
trees are said to be nearly as hardy as those of the wild crab-apple.
The variety is desirable only where hardiness and freedom from blight
are prime requisites.

The Sudduth pear was introduced about 1895, although the parent tree
was at that time fully seventy years old. It originated from seed
planted by Thomas Constant in 1820, in Sangamon County, Illinois.
Later, Judge Stephen A. Logan of Springfield, Abraham Lincoln's first
law partner, acquired the property on which the tree stood and from
him Titus Sudduth bought the place in 1862. Sudduth was so impressed
with the fruit that he had trees propagated by Augustine and
Company, Normal, Illinois, and disseminated under his name.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright becoming quite spreading, open-topped,
 hardy, productive; trunk stocky, shaggy; branches thick, smooth, dull
 reddish-brown, almost entirely covered with gray scarf-skin, sprinkled
 with numerous large, raised lenticels; branchlets slender, curved,
 long, with long internodes, dull reddish-brown, overspread with thin
 gray scarf-skin which is mingled with green, dull, smooth, glabrous,
 with conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, pointed, appressed, somewhat flattened. Leaves 3
 in. long, 1-5/8 in. wide, thin, velvety; apex taper-pointed; margin
 glandless, finely serrate; petiole 2 in. long, slender, tinged red,
 glabrous. Flower-buds small, short, conical, free, singly on very
 short spurs; flowers late, 1-1/8 in. across, in dense clusters,
 average 8 buds in a cluster; pedicels 7/8 in. long, thick, pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in late September and October; medium or below in size,
 2-1/4 in. long, 2-3/8 in. wide, roundish-oblate, slightly conical
 toward the apex; stem 7/8 in. long, slender; cavity acute, deep,
 narrow, smooth, sometimes lipped; calyx large, open; lobes separated
 at the base, long, acute; basin very shallow, narrow, obtuse,
 occasionally wrinkled; skin thin, tough, smooth, dull; color light
 green, without blush; dots very small, russet or greenish, very
 obscure; flesh greenish-white, firm, crisp, rather dry, subacid;
 quality medium to poor. Core large, closed, axile, with meeting
 core-lines; calyx-tube wide, conical; carpels ovate; seeds variable in
 size, wide, flat, obtuse.

The extremely early and highly flavored fruits, which are borne in
prodigious quantities, make this a very desirable pear for the home
garden. The fruits have no value for the markets, as they are small, do
not keep well, and are unattractive. The tree, while never large, is of
medium size, comes in bearing early, is hardy, and is as free as most
of its orchard associates from blight. Both fruit and foliage suffer
badly from pear-scab, and no amount of spraying can give the fruits a
fair cheek in seasons when this fungus is epidemic.

Van Mons is supposed to have originated this variety about 1800 as Diel
mentioned it among his best pears in 1812. Summer Doyenné was first
brought to the notice of American pomologists by William Kenrick, who
compiled a description of it as early as 1836. It does not, however,
appear to have been introduced until 1843. It was recommended for
general culture in the United States by the American Pomological
Society in 1852.

 Tree variable in size, upright, vigorous, very productive; trunk
 slender; branches slender, slightly zigzag, brownish, overlaid
 with gray scarf-skin, marked with numerous conspicuous lenticels;
 branchlets slender, long, light brown mingled with green, the new
 growth tinged with red, smooth, glabrous except near the ends of the
 new growth, with numerous raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, sharply pointed, plump, free; leaf-scars with
 prominent shoulders. Leaves 2-7/8 in. long, 1-1/8 in. wide, thin,
 leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin finely serrate; petiole 1-3/4
 in. long, tinged with pink. Flower-buds small, short, plump, free,
 singly on very short spurs; flowers showy, 1-1/4 in. across, in dense
 clusters, 7 to 9 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1-1/4 in. long, slender,
 pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in early August; small, 1-1/2 in. long, 1-5/8 in. wide,
 obovate-obtuse-pyriform, symmetrical; stem 1-1/8 in. long, slender;
 cavity obtuse, shallow, narrow, slightly furrowed, often lipped; calyx
 small, closed; lobes separated at the base, short, narrow, acuminate;
 basin shallow, obtuse, furrowed; skin thin, smooth, tender, waxen
 yellow, washed or blushed with bright red, deepening on the exposed
 cheek to crimson; dots numerous, small, russet, obscure; flesh tinged
 with yellow, fine-grained, tender and melting, juicy, variable in
 flavor and quality, pleasantly sprightly under favorable conditions;
 quality variable, good under the best conditions. Core closed, axile,
 with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, narrow, urn-shaped;
 carpels roundish-ovate; seeds small, narrow, flat, acute.

Tyson competes with Clapp Favorite as the precursor of the pear season
which is really opened by Bartlett. In every character of fruit and
tree excepting size and color of fruit, Tyson excels Clapp Favorite.
The quality of the fruit far excels that of Clapp Favorite and it is
better than that of Bartlett. Indeed, of commonly grown pears, the
characters of flesh and flavor are second only to those of the fruits
of Seckel. The flesh is melting and juicy, with a spicy, scented
sweetness that gives the fruit the charm of individuality. The pears
keep longer and ship better than those of Clapp Favorite; their season
in New York is from the middle of August to the middle of September.
Unfortunately, the pears are but medium in size, and are often poorly
colored, both of which defects appear on the fruits of this variety
as grown on the grounds of this Station and shown in the accompanying
illustration. The tree is the most nearly perfect of that of any pear
grown in America--the Kieffer, praiseworthy only in its tree, not
excepted. The tree is certainly as hardy as that of any other variety,
if not hardier, and resists better than that of any other sort the
black scourge of blight. Add to these notable characters large size,
great vigor, and fruitfulness, and it is seen that the trees are nearly
flawless. The only fault is, and this a comparatively trifling one,
that the trees are slow in coming in bearing. Tyson is the best pear
of its season for the home orchard, and has much merit for commercial
orchards. Were the fruits larger, it would rival Bartlett for the
markets. No other variety offers so many good starting points for the
pear-breeder.

Tyson originated as a wilding found about 1794 in a hedge on the land
of Jonathan Tyson, Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. The tree first bore fruit
in 1800. The pears proved to be so good that Mr. Tyson distributed
cions among his neighbors, but the variety was not generally
disseminated. About 1837, a Doctor Mease of Philadelphia sent cions
to B. V. French, Braintree, near Boston, who in turn distributed them
among his friends. The variety fruited here about 1842, and the fruit
was exhibited before the Massachusetts Horticultural Society under the
name Tyson. In 1848, at the National Convention of Fruit-Growers, Tyson
was recommended for general cultivation, and since that date the name
has appeared continuously in the catalogs of the American Pomological
Society.

 Tree very large, vigorous, upright-spreading, tall, dense-topped,
 hardy, productive; trunk very stocky, rough; branches thick, dull
 reddish-brown, overspread with gray scarf-skin, with few lenticels;
 branchlets slender, short, light brown mingled with green, smooth,
 glabrous, sprinkled with few small, inconspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, conical, pointed, plump, appressed or free.
 Leaves 2-3/4 in. long, 1-1/2 in. wide, thin; apex abruptly pointed;
 margin finely and shallowly serrate; petiole 1-5/8 in. long.
 Flower-buds small, short, conical, pointed, plump, free, singly on
 short spurs; flowers medium in season of bloom.

 Fruit matures in late August; medium in size, 2-1/8 in. long, 1-3/4
 in. wide, roundish-acute-pyriform, with unequal sides; stem 1-3/4 in.
 long, curved; cavity very shallow, obtuse, roughened, usually drawing
 up as a lip about the base of the stem; calyx open, small; lobes
 separated at the base, short, narrow, acute; basin shallow, narrow,
 flaring, slightly furrowed, compressed; skin tough, smooth, slightly
 russeted, dull; color deep yellow, usually blushed; dots numerous,
 very small, obscure; flesh tinged with yellow, granular around the
 basin, otherwise rather fine-grained, tender and melting, very juicy,
 sweet, aromatic; quality very good. Core small, closed, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube, short, wide, conical; seeds medium in size and
 width, plump, acute.

Urbaniste is another variety desirable for home use because of its
highly-flavored fruits--so sweet, rich, perfumed, and luscious as to
be a natural sweetmeat. The fruits are of but medium size and not
particularly handsome, but the taste excels the looks. The flesh is
as tender, sweet, juicy, and as delicately perfumed as that of Seckel
or White Doyenné, but with a distinct flavor and scent which give the
fruits the added charm of individuality. The crop ripens in October,
in a season when there are many other pears, but the fruits stand
comparison with those of any other variety and are welcome additions
to the fruit-basket. The trees have several defects, chief of which is
tardiness in coming in bearing, to remedy which grafting on the quince
is recommended. They are also susceptible to blight, and are not as
hardy as might be wished. Of all pears, the tree of this variety is one
of the handsomest--clean and tidy, slender and graceful, yet robust
and productive. Fruit and tree make this a valuable variety for home
plantings.

Urbaniste originated as a wilding in the gardens of the religious order
of Urbanistes, Mechlin, Belgium. After the suppression of this order in
1783, their gardens remained uncultivated for some time and produced
new seedlings of considerable merit. The beauty of one of these
attracted the attention of Count de Coloma, a well-known pomologist,
who acquired this property in 1786, and in due course propagated
and disseminated the variety under the name Urbaniste. Early in the
nineteenth century, Count de Coloma sent specimens of the pear to the
London Horticultural Society, which organization afterwards distributed
it in England about 1823. Thomas Andrew Knight sent cions to John
Lowell, Roxbury, Massachusetts, through whom it became disseminated in
the United States. The American Pomological Society added Urbaniste to
its fruit-catalog list in 1852.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright-spreading, slow-growing,
 productive with age; trunk slender, shaggy; branches stocky, shaggy,
 zigzag, reddish-brown, overspread with gray scarf-skin, sprinkled
 with numerous lenticels; branchlets long, reddish-brown mingled with
 grayish scarf-skin, smooth, zigzag, glabrous, marked with conspicuous,
 raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds large, obtuse, semi-free. Leaves 2-1/4 in. long, 7/8 in.
 wide, thin, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin finely serrate;
 petiole 1-1/2 in. long, slender. Flower-buds short, variable in shape,
 free.

 Fruit ripe in late October and early November; medium in size,
 2-3/8 in. long, 2 in. wide, obovate-obtuse-pyriform, with unequal
 sides; stem 5/8 in. long, short, thick; cavity obtuse, shallow,
 narrow, faintly russeted, furrowed, slightly lipped; calyx open;
 lobes separated at the base, narrow, obtuse; basin shallow, narrow,
 obtuse, slightly furrowed; skin thick, tough, roughened by the russet
 nettings, dull; color pale yellow, often with a faint russet-red blush
 on the exposed cheek and marked with nettings and patches of russet;
 dots numerous, small, russet, conspicuous; flesh tinged with yellow,
 granular especially around the core, tender and melting, buttery,
 juicy, sweet, pleasantly aromatic; quality very good. Core closed,
 with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds
 medium in size and width, long, plump, acute.

The fruits of Vermont Beauty elicit praise from all who see or taste
them. The bright-cheeked pears are as alluring to the eye as those of
any other, and are almost as delectable as those of Seckel, which they
resemble in shape, but are larger and handsomer. Of all pears, those
of this variety (or of Forelle, with which it may be identical) best
satisfy the eye for bright color. The crop ripens a little later and
keeps longer than that of Seckel, and for these reasons, and because of
the handsome appearance, should sell better. The pears will probably
be most used to grace the table and for dessert, but the somewhat more
sprightly flavor makes them better suited for all culinary purposes
than those of Seckel. The trees are scarcely less satisfactory than
the fruits. They are preëminent among their kind by virtue of large
size, rapidity of growth, productivity, and hardiness, the region
from which the variety came bespeaking greater hardihood to cold than
that possessed by the average variety. The trees rejoice in vigor and
health as do those of almost no other variety, and while hardly as
productive as those of Seckel, yet because of greater size the pears
fill the basket nearly as quickly. Vermont Beauty is one of the best of
the pears of its season, and deserves a place in the orchards of the
country for home and market.

Vermont Beauty is supposed to have originated in the nursery of
Benjamin Macomber, Grand Isle, Vermont, more than forty years ago.
Macomber maintained a small nursery, and this pear was one of several
hundreds planted for stock. The tree was budded in the usual manner,
but the bud failed to grow, and the original tree was allowed to stand
without another budding. After the variety fruited, it attracted so
much attention that Macomber propagated it. Later, it was introduced
by W. P. Rupert and Son, Seneca, New York. The American Pomological
Society, recognizing its worth, added the variety to its fruit-catalog
in 1899. There has long been doubt in the minds of the writers as to
whether Vermont Beauty is distinct from Forelle. Careful comparison has
been made of the fruit- and tree-characters of the two sorts, and it is
found that they are so closely allied as to be indistinguishable. It is
possible that a tree of the old German pear may have found its way into
Macomber's nursery and received the new name.

 Tree medium in size, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped, hardy,
 productive; trunk stocky, shaggy; branches zigzag, reddish-brown,
 thinly overspread with gray scarf-skin, with numerous large lenticels;
 branchlets very thick, long, reddish-brown mingled with green, thickly
 covered with ash-gray scarf-skin near the tips, smooth, glabrous
 except near the ends of the new growth, sprinkled with numerous small,
 roundish, conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, pointed, plump, free. Leaves 2-3/4 in. long,
 1-3/8 in. wide, leathery; apex abruptly-or taper-pointed; margin
 glandless, finely serrate; petiole 2 in. long, glabrous, slender,
 pinkish-green. Flower-buds small, short, conical, plump, free,
 singly on short spurs; flowers characteristically small, average 1
 in. across, in dense clusters, about 6 buds in a cluster, the petals
 unusually small; pedicels 7/8 in. long, slender, pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in late October and November; medium in size, 2-1/2 in.
 long, 2 in. wide, obovate-acute-pyriform, symmetrical; stem 3/4 in.
 long, curved; cavity extremely small or lacking, the flesh folded up
 around the base of the stem, occasionally lipped; calyx small, open;
 lobes separated at the base, short, narrow, acute; basin shallow,
 narrow, obtuse, smooth, symmetrical; skin thick, tough, smooth or with
 slight russet markings; color clear pale lemon-yellow, with a broad
 and brilliantly blushed cheek, fading at the sides into pinkish-red
 dots; dots numerous, very small, light russet, conspicuous; flesh
 tinged with yellow, granular at the center but fine-grained near the
 skin, tender and melting, very juicy, with a rich, vinous flavor;
 quality very good. Core closed, axile, with meeting core-lines;
 calyx-tube short, wide, conical; seeds large, wide, plump, acute.

Though large and handsome, the pears of this variety vary so much in
quality, often being wretchedly poor, that trees of it are now seldom
planted in America. The variety is not liked, also, because the trees
blight badly. The fruits, besides being large and handsome, keep well,
and are excellent for all culinary purposes. They are in season from
November to January. The pears have a strong musky smell, and are
more or less astringent. The quality depends largely on the soil, and
is best when the trees stand in a deep, warm loam. The fruits are
long-pyriform, usually one-sided, and are further characterized by
the peculiarity that the calyx is not in line with the axis, as in
other pears, but is on one side, generally opposite to that in which
the stalk is inserted as shown in the accompanying illustration. The
trees, barring susceptibility to blight, are about all that could be
desired--large, vigorous, handsome, and thrive both as standards and
dwarfs. Many old trees of largest size of this variety are still to be
found in New York, but young stock is now seldom set.

In 1760, this pear was found as a wilding by a French curate at
Villiers-en-Brenne. In due course it was introduced into England by
the Rev. W. L. Rahm, Vicar of Winkfield, in Berkshire, and from this
circumstance it lost its proper name, _Curé or Le Curé_, and wrongly
acquired that by which it is now known here and in England. The variety
was introduced to America early in the nineteenth century. It was
placed on the list of recommended fruits by the American Pomological
Society in 1852.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense-topped, hardy, very
 productive, long-lived; trunk and branches stocky; branches zigzag,
 greenish-brown overspread with grayish scarf-skin, with lenticels
 variable in number and size; branchlets curved, thick, long and
 willowy, with long internodes, light greenish-brown which is mingled
 with red on the newer growth, smooth, glabrous except near the ends of
 the new growth, sprinkled with conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, pointed, free. Leaves 3 in. long, 2-1/4 in.
 wide, thick, leathery; apex abruptly pointed; margin tipped with
 minute scattering glands, finely serrate; petiole variable in length,
 pinkish-green; stipules short, tinged with pink. Flower-buds small,
 short, conical, plump, free, singly on very short spurs.

 Fruit ripe December to January; large, 4-1/4 in. long, 3 in. wide,
 oblong-pyriform, with a long, tapering neck, with unequal sides; stem
 1-1/8 in. long, slender, curved; cavity lacking, with stem obliquely
 set without a depression and often with a fleshy fold around the
 base in the form of a lip; calyx large, open; lobes long, unusually
 broad, obtusely pointed; basin very shallow, narrow, obtuse, smooth,
 symmetrical; skin thick, tough, smooth, dull; color pale yellow,
 often with a faint trace of a brownish-red blush over the exposed
 cheek, marked with light russet around the calyx, and occasionally
 with russet flecks scattered over the surface; dots numerous, small,
 conspicuous, brownish-russet; flesh white, granular only near the
 center, tender and melting, juicy, somewhat astringent or with a
 sprightly muskiness, with no pleasant aroma; quality inferior for
 dessert but good for cooking. Core small, closed, axile, with clasping
 core-lines; calyx-tube long, narrow, funnel-shaped; carpels long-oval;
 seeds large, long, not very plump, often abortive.

This ancient and world-renowned pear, its fruits the most delectable of
any that come from a pear orchard, is now rarely planted in America.
It is being discarded because the small and comparatively unattractive
fruits fail to satisfy commercial demands. In the middle of the last
century, when there was almost a mania for the best of the European
pears, when fruits were judged by the palate rather than the eye as
now, White Doyenné was one of the most commonly planted varieties.
Proof of its popularity at home and abroad is found in the great
number of names under which it has been grown. A more serious fault
than small and unattractive pears is that the fruits and foliage
are inviting prey to the scab-fungus, which often cracks and scabs
the pears and defoliates the trees. Except in susceptibility to
scab, the trees are nearly perfect when grown in the soil which they
prefer--a rich clay, heavy rather than light. On such a soil, tree
and fruit attain perfection. The accompanying illustration shows this
pear at its best in color and size--a handsome fruit rather than
the unattractive product so often seen. Grown in a light soil, and
when scab is unchecked, the fruits are small, green, cracked, and
cankered--intolerable to sight and taste. Unfortunately, also, the
trees are ravaged by blight when that disease is epidemic. The faults
named have made the variety an outcast, but it should still receive
attention for the superb quality of its fruits where scab and blight
can be controlled.

This pear is one of the oldest of all varieties. It is impossible to
state whether it originated in France or was brought to that country
from Italy. A German, Henri Manger, who studied the origin of fruits,
states in his _Systematische Pomologie_, 1780, that the White Doyenné
originated with the Romans; he considered it to be their _Sementinum_.
Agostino Gallo, 1559, called the variety _Pera Ghiacciuola_. In 1660,
Claude Saint-Etienne described a _Poire de Neige_. Both of these
descriptions represent White Doyenné. In the sixteenth century and
for part of the seventeenth, the name _Ghiacciuola_ was accepted for
the variety in France with the synonym _Saint-Michel_. Leroy states
that Le Lectier, in his catalog of the fruit trees which he grew at
Orléans in 1628, changed the name to _Giaccole de Rome_, and Nicholas
de Bonnefonds modified it in the first edition of his _Jardinier
Francais_, 1652, to _Giacciola di Roma_. English pomologists have
mentioned this pear under a variety of names since early in the
seventeenth century. The names _Poire Doyenné_ and _White Doyenné_
have been most generally applied to it. The date of its introduction
to America is not known, but it was probably brought to this country
by the earliest French settlers. The first American catalogs mentioned
the variety, and it was extensively grown in the vicinity of New York
and Long Island where it was commonly called the _Virgalieu_ pear. In
the neighborhood of Boston, the name _Saint-Michael_ was applied to it;
while around Philadelphia it was called the _Butter Pear_. For nearly
a century, however, the variety has been most generally known in this
country as White Doyenné. At the Convention of Fruit-Growers held in
New York, in 1848, White Doyenné was included in a short list of pears
recommended for general cultivation. Since that date, the American
Pomological Society has given the variety a place in its fruit-catalog.

This is one of the good, early pears for the markets. It is more highly
prized in the Mississippi Valley than in New York and the Eastern
states where summer pears are raised in greater variety. The pears
are very attractive in size, shape, and particularly in the bright
lemon-yellow color, with a flaming cheek to the sun, the whole pear
being characteristically marked with small, russet dots set in a
pinkish circle. Of all summer pears the fruits of this one seem least
inclined to rot at the center, and usually keep longer and ship better,
although the skin is tender and bruises easily. The flesh is buttery,
moderately juicy, sweet and rich, with a faint, pleasant perfume. The
fruits are small but are usually larger than those of the well-known
Seckel, and are edible almost to the very center. The tree is large,
vigorous, prodigiously productive, as healthy as any, and a remarkably
handsome ornamental. Despite this catalog of virtues, Wilder Early is
not largely planted in New York.

Wilder Early is a chance seedling found by Charles A. Green, Rochester,
New York, about 1884, in Chautauqua County, New York. At the time of
its discovery the tree was already in bearing. The variety was named
after Marshall P. Wilder, President of the Massachusetts Horticultural
Society. The name first appeared in the fruit-catalog of the American
Pomological Society in 1899.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright, dense-topped, rapid-growing, hardy,
 very productive; branches zigzag, reddish-brown overspread with gray
 scarf-skin, with numerous lenticels; branchlets thick, very long,
 light greenish-brown, lightly streaked with ash-gray scarf-skin, dull,
 smooth, glabrous except near the tips of the new growth, sprinkled
 with many conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds small, short, pointed, appressed; leaf-scars prominent.
 Leaves 3-1/4 in. long, 1-7/8 in. wide, leathery; apex taper-pointed;
 margin very finely serrate; petiole 2 in. long, glabrous. Flower-buds
 small, short, conical, plump, free, singly on short spurs; flowers
 late, 1-3/16 in. across, white or tinged with pink, in dense clusters,
 average 7 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1/2 in. long, pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in late August; large, 2-3/4 in. long, 2-3/8 in. wide,
 oblong-pyriform, symmetrical; stem 3/4 in. long, very thick; cavity
 acute, narrow, russeted and with rays of russet extending over the
 sides, slightly compressed, rarely lipped; calyx large, open; lobes
 separated at the base, long, narrow, acuminate; basin very shallow,
 narrow, obtuse, wrinkled; skin thin, tender, smooth, dull; color
 pale lemon-yellow, with a pinkish blush on the exposed cheek often
 deepening to dark pink; dots characteristically distinct, very
 numerous, small, russet or russet-red; flesh white, stringy, tender
 and melting, buttery, moderately juicy, sweet, faintly aromatic;
 quality good. Core small, closed, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube
 long, narrow, conical; seeds long, narrow, acute.

Winter Bartlett is heralded from the Pacific Coast as a winter variety
bearing fruits similar to those of Bartlett. As the fruits grow in New
York there is a suggestion of Bartlett in the shape, color, and flavor
of the fruits, but in size, as the color-plate shows, the newcomer
falls far short of the older pear. The season is December and January,
a time when there are a half-dozen other good pears, and since this one
has no outstanding characters to make it notable, it is doubtful if
it will outlive a brief period of probation in eastern orchards. The
westerners say that the tree is very resistant to blight, a statement
neither proved nor disproved in the East as yet. The variety is worth
trying in a small way in New York.

This pear seems to have originated at Eugene, Oregon, some time prior
to 1880, and to have been introduced by D. W. Coolidge of Eugene,
although it must have been grown to some extent before Mr. Coolidge
brought it to the front. Because of its resemblance to Bartlett, it is
assumed that it is a seedling of that variety. The American Pomological
Society added Winter Bartlett to its catalog of fruits in 1909.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright, scraggly, open-topped, hardy,
 productive; branches stocky, smooth, light-brown overlaid with gray
 scarf-skin, with few lenticels; branchlets thick, curved, long, with
 long internodes, brownish-red, streaked with gray scarf-skin, glossy,
 smooth, glabrous, sprinkled with conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds large, long, conical, pointed, plump, free; leaf-scars with
 very prominent shoulders. Leaves 3-1/4 in. long, 1-3/8 in. wide,
 stiff; apex taper-pointed; margin finely serrate; petiole 2-1/4 in.
 long. Flower-buds conical, plump, free, singly on spurs variable
 in length; flowers very late, 1-1/2 in. across, in dense clusters,
 average 5 buds in a cluster; pedicels 1 in. long, thick, thinly
 pubescent.

 Fruit ripe in December and January; large, 3 in. long, 2-3/8 in.
 wide, oblong-obovate-pyriform; stem 1 in. long, thick, curved; cavity
 narrow, shallow, smooth, oblique; calyx small, nearly closed; lobes
 short; basin small, shallow, irregular; skin uneven in surface;
 color yellow, splashed with russet and often blushed on the exposed
 cheek with bright red; dots numerous, small, brownish-russet;
 flesh yellowish-white, fine-grained, tender, juicy, sweet,
 pleasant-flavored; quality good to very good. Core small, nearly
 closed, with meeting core-lines; calyx-tube short, wide; seeds large,
 long, plump, obtuse.

Winter Nelis is the standard winter pear in the United States.
Both fruits and trees possess several serious faults, but these
are outmatched by virtues which make the variety preëminent in its
season. The fruits are small and are often so poorly colored as to be
unattractive, but well grown they are sufficiently large for dessert
fruits and are very handsome in a much-russeted coat and a ruddy
cheek. Flesh and flavor are the chief assets of the fruits. The flesh
is tender, melting, juicy, luscious, with a rich, sweet, aromatic
flavor--one of the most delectable of all pears. The fruits keep, ship,
and sell well. The season is from Christmas to March, but the pears can
be kept until late spring in cold-storage. The trees begin badly, for
no variety is more difficult to grow well in the nursery. They thrive
only on standard stocks, refusing to do well on the quince unless
double worked. In the orchard, the trees are among the unmanageables.
They are small or of but medium size, with straggling, wayward tops
with habits of growth so self assertive that no art nor skill of the
pruner can bring the branches under control. The limbs are always
crooked; some bend inward toward the main stem, some are upright, some
droop, and no two behave in quite the same way. Notwithstanding the
illy-shaped tops, the trees are often enormously productive so that
the crop usually requires thinning. They bear almost annually; come in
bearing young; are fairly hardy; and are adapted to almost any soil or
situation provided, only, that the soil is fertile or well fertilized.
They are as nearly immune to blight as those of any other European
pear. The trees are characterized by two marked peculiarities: the
old wood is thickly set with small, short spurs; and they are about
the latest of all their kind in leafing out in the spring. There is
no better winter pear for either the commercial pear-grower or the
amateur, and the variety grows especially well in New York.

Winter Nelis was raised from seed by Jean Charles Nélis, Mechlin,
Belgium, early in the nineteenth century. It was introduced into
England by the London Horticultural Society under the name _La Bonne
Malinoise_. Subsequently this name was cancelled and that of Winter
Nelis adopted, the name which had been given the variety by Van Mons
in honor of the originator. In 1823, Thomas Andrew Knight, President
of the London Horticultural Society, sent cions of the variety to
John Lowell, Roxbury, Massachusetts, who, in his turn, shared them
with Robert Manning, Salem, Massachusetts, whence the sort was very
generally disseminated in this country and attained great popularity.
At the National Convention of Fruit-Growers held in New York in 1848,
Winter Nelis was included in a short list of pears recommended for
general cultivation. For more than half a century the name has appeared
in the fruit-catalogs of the American Pomological Society.

 Tree medium in size and vigor, spreading, hardy, very productive;
 trunk stocky; branches thick, zigzag, reddish-brown mingled with
 gray scarf-skin, marked with small lenticels; branchlets with short
 internodes, reddish-brown, dull, smooth, glabrous, with numerous
 raised, conspicuous lenticels.

 Leaf-buds medium to large, long, conical or pointed, free. Leaves
 3 in. long, 1-1/8 in. wide, elongated-oval, leathery; apex
 taper-pointed; margin varies from crenate to serrate; petiole 1-1/2
 in. long, slender. Flower-buds conical or pointed, free; flowers open
 late, 1-3/4 in. across, 6 or 7 buds in a cluster; pedicels 7/8 in.
 long, rather slender, lightly pubescent, greenish.

 Fruit ripe late November to early January; medium in size, 2-1/4
 in. long, about 2-1/4 in. wide, uniform in size and shape,
 roundish-obovate to obtuse-obovate-pyriform, quite symmetrical except
 for the unequal sides; stem 1-3/8 in. long, thick, curved; cavity
 obtuse, shallow, narrow, russeted, gently furrowed, occasionally
 lipped; calyx large, open; lobes separated at the base, short, broad,
 acute; basin shallow, obtuse, lightly furrowed, symmetrical; skin
 thick, tender, roughened with much russet, dull; color yellow with
 a tinge of green, dotted with grayish-russet and with many russet
 streaks and patches on the exposed cheek which is usually blushed
 with bright red; dots numerous, small, russet, conspicuous; flesh
 yellowish-white, quite granular at the center and underneath the skin,
 tender and melting, buttery, very juicy, sweet, aromatic; quality very
 good. Core large, closed, axile, with clasping core-lines; calyx-tube
 short, wide, conical; seeds large, wide, long, plump, acute.

Possibly no pear has been more widely advertised during the last
quarter-century than Worden Seckel. Nurserymen and pear-growers alike
describe it as a better variety than Seckel, and say that it ought to
take the place of that good old sort of which it is a seedling. But
it is not driving Seckel out in most pear regions, though in many it
is considered the more profitable pear of the two. It is a splendid
pear, but falls short of Seckel in not being quite as dependable in
different soils and climates; the trees are not as vigorous, though
just as productive in many places, they are not quite as resistant to
blight, and the fruits are not as high in quality. On the other hand,
the pears are larger and handsomer. Well grown, the fruits of Worden
Seckel are voluptuously handsome in form and color. The pears are
smooth, glossy, trim of contour, well turned, unusually uniform, with
a beautifully blushed cheek on a handsome green and yellow background.
The accompanying illustration does not do the pear justice in size or
color and shows a lack of symmetry not usually present. When the crop
is thinned so that the fruits attain their largest size, no pear is
handsomer or will bring a higher price on the fruit-stands. The crop
comes in with Seckel, but keeps longer, lasting until December in
cold-storage. The tree is very hardy and bears young, but does poorly
in the nursery. Commercial growers should give this variety a thorough
test, and amateurs everywhere will find it worth planting.

Worden Seckel, as its name suggests, is a seedling of Seckel, raised by
Sylvester Worden, Minetto, Oswego County, New York, about 1881. Smiths
and Powell, Syracuse, New York, placed it on the market about 1890.
The American Pomological Society added the variety to its fruit-list in
1909.

 Tree large, vigorous, upright-spreading, rapid-growing, very
 productive; trunk thick; branches reddish-brown, nearly covered with
 thin, gray scarf-skin, marked with numerous lenticels; branchlets
 short, with internodes variable in length, light greenish-brown,
 dull, glabrous except near the ends of the new growth, sprinkled with
 numerous small, conspicuous, raised lenticels.

 Leaf-buds very small, short, pointed, appressed. Leaves 2-1/2 in.
 long, 1-1/2 in. wide, thick, leathery; apex taper-pointed; margin
 tipped with few minute glands, finely or coarsely serrate; petiole
 1-1/2 in. long, glabrous, slender, tinged with red; stipules very
 small when present. Flower-buds small, short, conical, sharply
 pointed, plump, free, singly on very short spurs; flowers showy, 1-1/2
 in. across, in dense clusters, 8 or 10 buds in a cluster; pedicels
 1-1/4 in. long, slightly pubescent.

 Fruit ripe late September to October; medium in size, 2-1/2 in. long,
 2-1/8 in. wide, obovate-acute-pyriform, symmetrical; stem 3/4 in.
 long, thick; cavity very shallow and obtuse or lacking, the flesh
 folded up around the base of the stem and often lipped; calyx open,
 large; lobes narrow, acute; basin shallow, narrow, obtuse, smooth
 or gently furrowed, symmetrical; skin thin, tender, smooth, glossy;
 color pale golden-yellow, blushed on the exposed cheek with solid
 bright red, becoming almost crimson in highly colored specimens;
 dots numerous, small, russet, obscure; flesh yellowish-white or dull
 white, fine-grained near the skin, granular at the center, tender and
 melting, buttery, very juicy, characteristically spicy and aromatic;
 quality very good. Core closed, axile, with meeting core-lines;
 calyx-tube conical; carpels ovate; seeds wide, plump, obtuse.

=Amande Double. 1.= Downing _Fr. Trees Am._ 353. 1845.

_Walker._ =2.= _Ibid._ 877. 1869.

The name Amande signifies almond and has reference to its flavor.
Amande Double is a seedling of Van Mons which probably derives its
qualifying name from the fact that it has double kernels. In 1834-5 Van
Mons sent it to Robert Manning of Salem, Mass., under the number 135,
and how it acquired the name of _Walker_ in this country is not known.

_Ambrette d'Hiver._ =3.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:112, fig. 1867.

A French dessert pear of ancient but uncertain origin. It was mentioned
by M. Le Lectier of Orléans in 1628 in his catalog, and was shown by
him to have been cultivated under the name of _Trompe-Coquin_. It has
also been thought to be the pear _Myrapia_ mentioned by Pliny, and to
have been so named because of the myrrh-like perfume. The name Ambrette
was given to the variety on account of its musk-like flavor, resembling
the scent of the flower which in France is called Ambrette. Fruit below
medium, globular-oval, tapering toward stalk, yellowish-olive; flesh
yellowish or greenish-white; formerly held in high esteem but now
ranking only as second-rate; Nov. to Jan.

_Fruit Man._ 177. 1884.

Switser, writing in England in 1724, said that this variety was
introduced to that country from France "among that noble collection of
fruit that was planted in the Royal Gardens in St. James's Park soon
after the Restoration, but is now cut down." No French author, however,
appears to mention it under this name. It was formerly to be found in
many old English gardens but now seems to have dropped out of favor.
Fruit medium, globular-obovate, greenish-yellow, slightly russeted
and covered with small, gray specks; flesh buttery and in England
possessing a high flavor, melting, rich, sugary, perfumed; first for
dessert; Sept. but does not keep long.

=America. 1.= _Mag. Hort._ =25=:205, fig. 12. 1859. =2.= Downing _Fr.
Trees Am._ 658. 1869.

It was said of Francis Dana, the indefatigable pomologist of
Boston, that he saved the seed of all good pears that he ate, and
that from these he produced sixteen new, good varieties of which
America was one. It is a handsome pear and in 1859 was considered
an important acquisition because it ripens in the early part of the
winter when the number of choice varieties is limited. Fruit very
large, globular-ovate, somewhat angular, with an uneven surface,
dull greenish-yellow, much clouded with dull russet, and sprinkled
heavily with large russet dots; flesh yellowish-white, rather coarse,

=1=:122, fig. 1867.

Ananas was originally introduced to Holland from France where it had
been cultivated for many years under the name _De Bouchet_, a name
given to it during the reign of Louis XIV, 1643-1715, by La Quintinye,
Director of the Royal Gardens. Fruit medium; form rather variable,

_Ananas de Courtray._ =3.= Mas _Pom. Gen._ =1=:79, fig. 40. 1872.

The origin of this variety is unknown, but it is believed to have
been a chance seedling raised at Courtrai, Flanders, as M. Six, who
established himself in that town in the business of a gardener about
the year 1784, found it already extensively grown there. Fruit large,
pyramidal and often inclining to oval, bright yellow changing to
lemon-yellow and much dotted and splashed with light-colored russet;

Gen._ =6=:111, fig. 440. 1880.

The origin of this variety is unknown beyond the fact that it was
cultivated near Montfaucon, Maine-et-Loire, Fr., previous to 1850. At
first it was known as the "_Polyforme_" owing to its very variable
shape but was subsequently given its present name which is that of a
twist of tobacco. Fruit medium or rather large, conic-pyriform, but
often irregular and variable, sometimes much swelled below the middle,
mammillate around the calyx, yellow, washed with fawn; flesh white,
rather fine and buttery, gritty, melting; juice sweet and perfumed;
second; late Sept.

=Andrew Murray. 1.= _Guide Prat._ 80. 1895.

=Andrews. 1.= Hovey _Fr. Am._ =1=:97, Pl. 1851. =2.= Downing _Fr. Trees
Am._ 451, fig. 1857.

Samuel Downer introduced this pear soon after the Massachusetts
Horticultural Society was organized in 1829. He stated "that it
originated in Dorchester, and that the original tree was purchased
about 60 years ago by John Andrews of Boston." Fruit rather large,
pyriform, one-sided, pale yellowish-green, with a dull red cheek; flesh
greenish-white, full of juice, melting, having a vinous flavor; first;
early Sept.

=Ange. 1.= Duhamel _Trait. Arb. Fr._ =2=:138. 1768. =2.= Leroy _Dict.
Pom._ =1=:131, fig. 1867. =3.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 480. 1884.

This is one of the most ancient varieties in France. At a very early
date it was dedicated to the "_Angels_" and later to the "Virgin Mary"
and was known by the two names simultaneously from the sixteenth to the
nineteenth century. Fruit small to medium, variable but generally more
globular-turbinate than oblong or ovate, deep green changing to yellow,
dotted with gray, washed with red-brown on the side to the sun; flesh
white, melting, very juicy, sugary, acidulous, having a strong perfume
of anis; first for dessert and also for preserves; Aug. and Sept.

=Angel. 1.= Thomas _Am. Fruit Cult._ 693. 1897.

Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:133, figs. 1867.

_St. Martial._ =4.= Prince _Pom. Man._ =1=:79. 1831.

Henri Manger thought this pear identical with the pear _Liceriana_ or
_Liciniana_ of which Pliny spoke and which bears the name of Licinius,
the Roman tribune and consul. In 1690 Jean Merlet described a pear
under the name _Angélique_ which appears to be the same, and said it
was much esteemed in Languedoc under the name _Saint-Martial_. It
remains that its origin is ancient and uncertain, though it seems
quite likely, as M. Leroy thought, that it originated in Languedoc,
Gironde, Fr. Switser considered it was introduced into England about
1708. For upwards of 100 years it was grown there under the name _Saint
Martial_. It does not appear when it was first brought to this country.
Fruit above medium to large, obtuse-pyriform, uneven in outline,
glossy green changing as it ripens to pale yellow or greenish-yellow,
the whole strewed with brown dots and a few patches of russet; flesh
whitish, semi-fine, sweet and sugary, breaking, agreeable, not rich in
perfume; second for dessert and cooking; Jan. to Apr.

yellow ground; flesh fine, melting, juicy; good; Sept. and Oct. Tree
vigorous and fertile.

=Angélique Leclerc.= =1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =11=:137, fig. 1867. =2.=
Mas _Pom. Gen._ =3=:7, fig. 100. 1878.

This variety was raised from seed by Léon Leclerc, Laval, Mayenne,
Fr., about 1848. Fruit medium and often large, regular, long-ovate,
greenish-yellow, shaded with pale rose on the cheek next the sun and
dotted with russet; flesh white, very closely grained, melting, rough
or gritty round the core, juicy, sugary, acidulous, having a delicate
aroma; first; Oct. to Dec.

=Angélique de Rome.= =1.= Duhamel _Trait. Arb. Fr._ =2=:239. 1768. =2.=
Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:136, fig. 1867.

With the exception of M. Duhamel du Monceau, no pomologist of the
sixteenth or seventeenth century mentioned this pear. Henri Manger
writing in 1783, thought it identical with the "_pira Tiberiana_," a
variety which Pliny tells us was a favorite with the Emperor Tiberius.
Fruit medium, globular, obtuse-pyriform, darkish yellow, dotted with
fine gray spots, always washed with rose on the side next the sun;
flesh whitish, a little coarse, gritty around the core, full of rich,
sugary juice; second; Oct to Dec.

=Angleterre d'Hiver.= =1.= Duhamel _Trait. Arb. Fr._ =2=:198. 1768.
=2.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:138, fig. 1867.

According to Leroy this variety was grown in France in the middle of
the seventeenth century, its grafts having been brought from England.
Fruit medium, oblong-obovate-pyriform, pale yellow, spotted with fawn
and slightly washed with red; flesh white, semi-fine, melting, rather
gritty around the core, juicy, sugary, with a sweet and agreeable
flavor; a good kitchen pear; Dec. to Mar.

=Angleterre Nain.= =1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:140, fig. 1867. =2.=
Downing _Fr. Trees Am._ 661. 1869.

This variety was raised from seed in 1832 at Paris by Edouard Sageret.
It appeared first under the name _Angleterre parfumée_ and was so
published in 1835, but for some reason was renamed. Fruit rather above
than below medium, turbinate, obtuse, swelled and always more enlarged
on one side than on the other; skin rough to the touch, dull green,
uniformly dotted with clear russet; flesh whitish, fine, breaking,
gritty at the center; juice abundant, fresh, sweet, with a musky savor;
first; Sept. and Oct.

=Angobert.= =1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:142, fig. 1867. =2.= Downing
_Fr. Trees Am._ 661. 1869.

_Á Gobert._ =3.= Duhamel _Trait. Arb. Fr._ =2=:191. 1768.

Toward the end of the eighteenth century, 1780-83, Henri Manger claimed
that he had identified the Angobert with the _Signina_ or _Testacea_
of Columella and Pliny. Fruit very large, variable but generally
obovate-pyriform, distorted, enlarged around the calyx end, dull
yellow, dotted and streaked with fawn, washed with red on the side of
the sun; flesh white, coarse, juicy, sweet, having a rather agreeable
after-flavor of musk; third for the table but first for the kitchen.

=Angoisse.= =1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:145, fig. 1867.

_Winter Bon Chretien._ =2.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 666. 1884.

This is one of the most ancient French pears having been described in
the year 1094 in a chronological manuscript attributed to Geoffroy,
the Prior of the Benedictine monastery of Vigeois in the Diocese of
Limoges, in which it was stated to have derived its name from the
village of Angoisse in the old Province of Limonsin, Fr. Fruit small
to medium, turbinate, obtuse, swelled, golden-yellow, dotted, marbled
with fawn and washed with brownish-red on the side to the sun; flesh
whitish, slightly melting, coarse, always very gritty at the center;
juice excessively abundant, acidulous, sugary; third for dessert,
second for cooking, first for cider; Dec. to Apr.

=Angora.= =1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:147, fig. 1867. =2.= Mas _Pom.
Gen._ =5=:35, fig. 306. 1880.

This is a member of a group of pears rather loosely termed Pound Pears.
By some authors Angora is given as a synonym for _Belle Angevine_ or
_Uvedale's St. Germain_. In an account of a voyage he undertook in
1700 on command of King Louis XIV of France, M. Tournefort, the noted
botanist, states that he saw at Beibasas, Asia Minor, the pears known
in Constantinople as Angora. In 1832, Léon Leclerc imported it into
France from Constantinople, having obtained it with difficulty through
the French Ambassador at the Golden Horn. Fruit above medium to large,
pyriform, obtuse, swelled around the center, rather irregular in form;
skin thick, hard to cut, pale yellow, finely dotted with fawn and
bearing some patches of fawn; flesh white, rather coarse, semi-melting,
gritty at the center; juice plentiful and rich in sugar after the
manner of sweet wine, little perfume; second; Oct. and Nov.

=Angoucha.= =1.= _Guide Prat._ 82. 1876. =2.= Mas _Pom. Gen._ =7=:43,
fig. 502. 1881.

Originated in the Department of the Aube, France. In the arrondisements
of Troyes and Bar-sur-Seine it is also called _Courte queue_ i. e.
"Short Stem;" and by M. Baltet-Petit, it was described in the "Annales
de Flore et Pomone," under the name _Belle Chaouce_, the name of
the canton where it was very generally cultivated. Fruit medium,
obtuse-conic-ovate, regular in contour, dark green sprinkled with
numerous regularly spaced, brown dots often comingled under a cloud of
russet of same color, at maturity the green becomes an intense yellow,
the russet golden, and on the side of the sun is a wash of light
orange-red; flesh yellowish-white, semi-fine, dense, breaking; juice
sufficient and rich in sugar; good for cooking, winter.

=Anna Audusson.= =1.= _Pom. France_ =3=:No. 110, Pl. 110. 1865. =2.=

1872.

This variety is of ancient but unknown origin. Several varieties have
been described under this name, but the pear here described is the
German variety spoken of by J. V. Sickler about 1800 and extensively
grown in the environs of Sachsenburg and Kanneburg. Fruit below medium,
globular-oblate, not regular, olive-yellow, much dotted and russeted,
and moderately washed with brownish-red on the side exposed to the sun;

=Archduke of Austria.= =1.= _Mag. Hort._ =3=:50. 1837.

Manning in the Pomological Notices in the _Magazine of Horticulture_
said: "This tree bears well every year; the fruit is handsome, but very
dry and of inferior quality. Ripe in September. It may prove to have
been received under a wrong name."

=Archiduc Charles.= =1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:153, fig. 1867.

An old French variety described under various names at different
times and places, the earliest being by Merlet in 1675. It acquired
the synonym of _Ognonet_ in the eighteenth century from its swelled
onion-like form. Fruit small, obovate-obtuse-pyriform; pale lively

small, globular, uniformly greenish-yellow, thickly dotted; flesh
aromatic, vinous; first for dessert; late Nov.

=Argent.= =1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:156, fig. 1867.

Adrianus Junius, a Dutch botanist of the sixteenth century, identified
the _pear of silver_ or _the money pear_ with the _Nardina_ of the
Romans, though his contemporary, Jacques Dalechamp of Normandy in his
"_Histoire des plantes_," 1585, connected it with the _Liceriana_
mentioned by Pliny. _Nardina_ or _Nard_ was an ointment smelling
strongly of musk and lavender, from which the ancient pear no doubt
took its name, but the flesh of Argent does not give out any such
aroma. Henry Manger writing in 1783 thought that the _Poire d'Argent_
which we have today is the _Liceriana_ of Pliny, agreeing with
Dalechamp. Fruit small; form globular-obtuse-pyriform but usually
mammillate at the summit, greenish-yellow, dotted with russet all over;
flesh dead white, fine and melting, juicy, gritty at core; quality
second; Aug. and Sept.

ends, green, tinged with yellow, very much marked with dots and patches
of russet; stem medium long, stout, curved, inserted without cavity;
calyx large, open; basin shallow; flesh white, moderately juicy, tough
but crisp, astringent; quality poor; a late keeper.

Prat._ 82, 231. 1876.

Believed to have originated in Asia. Merlet wrote of it in 1675 and
in 1690 when it had probably only recently been introduced into
France. Fruit medium, globular, slightly flattened at the base and
nearly always mammillate at the summit, clear green, passing into
greenish-yellow at maturity, dotted all over with brown-russet and

was conferred upon it at the meeting of the Indiana Horticultural
Society, December, 1892, and in November, 1893, it received a first
class certificate of merit from the Massachusetts Horticultural
Society. In 1898, at the December meeting of the Illinois State
Horticultural Society it was reported "a winter pear of good quality,
apparently not ripe at this season; of local origin; a good keeper;
an abundant bearer," and was recommended for trial in the experiment
station of the State. Fruit medium size, oblong-pyriform, yellow
russeted; flesh buttery, juicy, melting; good; very late.

This ancient French pear appeared under the name _Muscat de Nancy_ in
Le Lectier's _Catalogue de son verger et plant_ in 1628, and was sold
in Nancy over 300 years ago. It is extensively grown in Germany in the
valleys of the Rhine and in the plains of Coblenz and Mayence under

=Autocrat.= =1.= _Jour. Hort._ 3rd Ser. =3=:260. 1881.

Described in the Journal of Horticulture, London, as a new and very
large pear ripening at the end of October. It was a seedling from

distinct in growth and fruit.

=Autumn Bergamot= (English). =1.= _Pom. Mag._ =3=:120, Pl. 1830. =2.=
Lindley _Guide Orch. Gard._ 352. 1831.

The English Autumn Bergamot or _Common Bergamot_ is a distinct variety
and not synonymous with the _Bergamotte d'Automne_ of France. Writing
in the early part of the eighteenth century, Switzer stated, and his
statement was endorsed by Lindley in 1831, that the Autumn Bergamot
was introduced into England in the days of Julius Caesar, that it was
possibly the _Assyrian Pear_ of Virgil, and was in that case to have
been found in the "once celebrated and famous gardens of Alcinöus."
This is a doubtful conjecture, though without doubt the variety is of
very ancient origin. Fruit small, globular-obtuse, yellowish-green,
dull brown where exposed to the sun and profusely speckled with gray
russet; flesh greenish-white, tender, melting, somewhat gritty at the
core, juicy, and of a rich flavor; a dessert pear of first quality;
Oct. Tree vigorous, prolific, forms a handsome standard and succeeds on
either quince or pear.

=4.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:184, fig. 1867.

This seedling of Van Mons was described in 1830 in the London
Horticultural Society's Garden as a new Flemish pear. It was received
there from Van Mons without a name and so became known in the
collection as Autumn Colmar from a fancied resemblance of its flavor
to that of the old Colmar. Fruit large, obtuse-pyriform, rounded at
the base, lemon-yellow, strewed with dots and patches of russet; flesh
coarse, sweet, juicy, astringent, rather gritty at the core; second;
Sept. and Oct.

greenish-yellow when quite ripe, russeted in patches, flesh yellowish,
with pale salmon tinge like that of Joséphine de Malines, tender,
fine-grained, very juicy, juice rich, sugary, aromatic; first, though a
little uncertain; Oct.

Raised from seed by F. J. Graham, Cranford, Eng., about 1852 and
exhibited before the British Pomological Society in 1858 under the
name _Graham's Bergamot_. It was granted a first class certificate from
the Royal Horticultural Society. Prior to being placed on the market in
1863 it was renamed Autumn Nelis because of the similarity of the tree
and fruit to Winter Nelis. Fruit rather above medium and equal to a
large Winter Nelis, obovate-pyriform, greenish-yellow, almost entirely
covered with brown-russet; flesh yellowish, very tender, melting and
buttery, with abundance of rich, aromatic, sugary juice and having an
exquisite flavor; a first class dessert fruit; Oct.

For many centuries Balosse has been grown in France on the banks of the
Marne, especially in the neighborhood of Châlons where there existed
in 1862 a specimen which was considered to be more than 300 years of
age. On account of its abundant crops yielded without cultivation, the
tree has been a favorite with the farmers of France. Fruit moderate

_Present Royal of Naples._ =3.= _Mag. Hort._ =4=:395. 1838.

Prévost, who died at Rouen in 1849, wrote of this pear that he
considered it identical with the _Présent royal de Naples_ which it
is said obtained its name from the fact that the King of Naples
about the end of the eighteenth century sent a number of these pears
to Prince Charles of Württemberg to remind him to forward a promised
white stag. Fruit large, by error classed by some as a Pound pear,
oblong-obtuse-pyriform, greenish-yellow, covered with patches and dots

The Belle Angevine described by Leroy is a very beautiful pear,
brilliant in color, of large size and handsome shape, but,
unfortunately, not good for dessert and only second class for the
kitchen. Properly Belle Angevine is a synonym of Pound or Uvedale's St.
Germain, yet Leroy holds this Belle Angevine as distinct.

363. 1882.

The editors of the "New Duhamel," 1825, said of this pear that it
was of recent origin and as it had not been previously named they
"dedicated it to M. Bessa as a testimony of satisfaction for the
assiduity evinced by him in the completion of the designs of that
work." In _Le Bon Jardinier_ it is classed among pears "remarkable for
their size." Fruit large, globular, the two extremities diminishing
very perceptibly, especially that next the stem, very light green
faintly approaching yellow at full maturity and interspersed by some
small, russet specks; flesh somewhat firm, bland and agreeable, not

_Amoselle panachée._ =2.= _Le Bon Jard._ 363. 1882.

Of interest on account of the curious variegation of its fruit and
wood. The fruit differs from that of the Bergamotte d'Holland in the
variegated green brown of its skin; flesh deficient in juice and
wanting in delicacy and leaves an unpleasant taste behind; second for
cooking; Dec. to April.

=Bergamote Philippot. 1.= Baltet _Cult. Fr._ 370. 1908.

Described by Baltet as, "A beautiful fruit, grey and bronzed; good for
stewing."

=Bergamote Rose. 1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:256, fig. 1867.

This curious variety was raised by A. Bivort from seed beds in the
garden of the Society Van Mons and first bore fruit in 1848. It is
endowed with so pronounced a scent of rose that the producer hoped from
it and another variety called Parfum de Rose it might be possible to
create a new class of pears. Fruit small, oblate, bronze, strewed with
grayish-white dots, some brownish stains, scaly; flesh white stained
with carmine, scented, rather coarse, breaking, seldom gritty; juice
sufficient, saccharine, having an odor and flavor similar to that of
roses; third; Jan. and Feb.

=Bergamotte d'Anvers. 1.= _Guide Prat._ 85. 1895.

1768. =2.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:223, fig. 1867.

_Rote Bergamotte._ =3.= Mathieu _Nom. Pom._ 271. 1889.

Authorities fail to agree on the origin of this pear. Benedictus
Curtius, a Florentine author writing in 1536, thought it had birth at
Bergamo in Lombardy. But in 1644, Jean Bodaeus, a Dutch physician, in
his translation of the _Historia Plantarum_ of Theophrastus, states
that the Bergamote came from Asia, whence the Romans had imported
it to Italy and that it was known to them as the _Pirum Regium_ or
pear of Kings. If it originated in Asia, the probability is that its
birth-place was Pergamum, a village of Asia Minor between the Ægean and
Marmora seas. This view was accepted in the eighteenth century by such
authorities as Lacour, Henri Manger and Ménage, and later by Leroy.
Fruit medium; variable but usually globular-oblate, greenish-yellow,
dotted and striped with russet, flesh whitish, fine, melting, generally
gritty, sweet, savory; first; Oct. to Jan.

=Bergamotte Bouvant. 1.= _Guide Prat._ 103. 1895.

=Bergamotte Bufo. 1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:228, fig. 1867. =2.= Hogg
_Fruit Man._ 498. 1884.

_Kröten Bergamotte._ =3.= Mathieu _Nom. Pom._ 244. 1889.

Le Lectier says this pear was cultivated at Orleans in 1628 under the
name of _Crapant_ or Toad on account of the rough character of its
skin. It was also known in Germany in 1690 under this latter name and
as _Oignon rosat_ by reason of its shape and the perfume of its juice.
In 1846 in France, because of the supposed inelegance of the word
"crapant," its name was changed to Bufo, the Latin name of a toad.
Fruit above medium, globular-oblate, even and regular like a true
Bergamot; skin rough, dark yellow, dotted and marbled with fawn and
usually also bearing some large brown stains; flesh white, melting,
fine; juice sufficient, vinous, acidulous, sugary, savory, recalling
the scent of the rose; excellent dessert pear; late Oct.

_Bergamote du Bugey._ =3.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:229, fig. 1867.

This is a pear of ancient and uncertain origin. It has a large number
of synonyms. Claude Saint-Etienne, writing in 1660, and La Quintinye,
in 1690, two of the best describers of this pear, each called it
by the name Bugi. Its synonym, _Pera Spina_, attributed to Merlet,
appears to indicate an Italian origin to it. Fruit medium and sometimes
larger, globular-turbinate, generally very regular, clear olive-green,
covered with large, fawn dots intermingled with brownish patches;
flesh yellowish-white, semi-melting, semi-fine, seldom gritty; juice

Bergamotte Silvange was found in the woods of the Metz district,
Lorraine, about the middle of the eighteenth century. The fruit is very
variable in form and quality so that writers have been led to speak
of three sorts of pears called Silvange--the yellow, the long, and
the green. Fruit medium, globular-turbinate or obovate or of Bergamot
shape; skin rough, bright green on the shaded side, darker where
exposed to the sun, sprinkled with large, gray dots and stained with

_Bonne de Soulers._ =3.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:487, fig. 1867.

This pear is an old French dessert fruit the first mention of which was
by Merlet in 1675 who described it as a species of winter Bergamotte
of good flavor and long keeping. Fruit medium, long-obovate, almost
oval; skin smooth, shining, pale greenish-yellow, covered with dots of
fawn and faintly tinged with brick-red on the side next the sun; flesh
white, tender, melting, free from granulations, juicy, saccharine,
slightly acidulous, with a characteristic and pleasant flavor; in
France, of first quality and considered superior to Easter Beurré; in
England only second, being too tender for the climate; Jan. to Mar. or
Apr.

_Iron Pear._ =9.= Cole _Am. Fr. Book_ 174. 1849.

The Romans cultivated a _Pound Pear_ during the first century of the
Christian era. In 1652 Claude Mollet describes a _Pound Pear_. Several
subsequent writers describe the same pear as _Livre_, _De Livre_, or
_Poire de Livre_. In Worcester, Eng., in the sixteenth century a pear
known as _Black Worcester_, _Black Pear of Worcester_, or Parkinson's
_Warden_ came under general cultivation as a "Warden" or baking pear
of which it forms the type. These two pears appear to be identical.
Mas makes _Black Worcester_ a synonym of _De Livre_, Hogg states that
they very much resemble each other, the authors of _Guide Pratique de
l'Amateur de Fruits_ list them as synonymous, and Bunyard says that he
believes that they are almost certainly identical. _Black Worcester_
is retained as the name of the variety because it is now most commonly
used. Tree vigorous, hardy, bears well as a standard; young shoots dark
yellow-olive, diverging; branches inclining downward with the weight
of the fruit. Fruit large, obovate; skin thick, green, rough, nearly
covered with dark russet, occasionally with a dull tinge next the sun;
calyx small, nearly closed, set in a wide and rather deep basin; stem
about an inch long, very stout, woody, inserted without depression;
flesh pale yellow, hard, crisp, coarse, flavorless, rather gritty; a
good cooking pear; Nov. to Feb.

side sometimes more swollen than the other, green becoming yellow on
approaching maturity, bright vermilion on side exposed to the sun;
flesh breaking; juice rich and sugary; good; July.

_Spanish Warden._ =3.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 648. 1884.

The origin of _Bon-Chrétien d'Espagne_ or _Spanish Warden_ is ancient
and uncertain. Merlet described it in 1675, and so did La Quintinye,
in 1692. It was well known; for Messrs. Simon-Louis of Metz, Lorraine,
gave it some forty synonyms in their 1895 catalog. Fruit large,
pyriform, very ventriculous in its lower half where it is more or
less bossed, the upper part narrows to an obtuse end; skin thick,
greenish-yellow changing to yellow, dotted and marked with fawn-russet,
and highly colored with vivid red on the side exposed to the sun; flesh
white, coarse, breaking, juicy, with a pleasant, brisk flavor and musky

Origin ancient and unknown but was cultivated in French gardens about
the end of the sixteenth century, being mentioned by Olivier de Serres
in 1600, and by Le Lectier of Orléans in 1628. It has been cultivated
all over Europe for over three centuries and has consequently acquired
a number of synonyms. Fruit large, pyriform, irregular in form, yellow,
with orange blush on side next the sun, and strewed with green specks;
flesh yellowish, crisp, coarse-grained, very juicy and of a rich, sweet
and pleasant flavor; second; early Sept.

_Bon-Chrétien d'Auch._ =3.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 533. 1884.

A volume might be filled with a record of the endeavors to determine
the origin of this pear. As to its great antiquity all are agreed. It
is established that it was imported into France from Italy in 1495 by
Charles VIII on his conquest of the kingdom of Naples, but whether it
was the _Crustuminum_ of the Romans or whether it received its name at
the beginning of Christianity remains uncertain. One explanation of
the name was that François de Paul, the founder of a monkish order,
being called to the court of Louis XI for the recovery of his health,
was styled by that monarch "le bon Chrétien," and that he brought with
him from Calabria some of this fruit which henceforth acquired the
name it bears. That suggestion, however, is evidently erroneous as
Saint François de Paul's visit to the King at Tours took place in 1483
whereas this pear was introduced to France in 1495. It is thought not
improbable that the name is derived from the Greek panchresta, meaning
"all good," of which the Latin _Crustuminum_ of the Romans may also be
a derivation. Fruit large and sometimes very large, variable in form,
irregularly pyriform or obovate-turbinate, rather rough to the touch,
dull greenish-yellow, some brown next the sun, and strewed with small,
russet dots; flesh whitish, crisp, juicy, sweet, aromatic and vinous; a
dessert pear of merit, first class for cooking; Dec. to Mar.

_Summer Rose._ =3.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 652. 1884.

An ancient French pear of unknown origin. Writing of it in 1586
Jacques Daléchamp thought it identical with the pear _Nard_, of the
Greeks. This, however, has not been substantiated; but the pear was in
early times spread generally through France under a variety of local
names. One Jehan de Meung, a poet born near Orléans in 1280, wrote
of it, as also did Gilles Ménage in 1694 who said it was "a kind of
pears so called because of their hardness, their whiteness and their
taste of rose." It is probable that it takes its name _Cailleau_,
_Calliot_, _Caillou_, _Caillorosar_, _Caillot_, from the _caillou_,
a pebble, because of the grit with which it is filled. Fruit medium,
globular-oblate, yellowish, with stains of fawn-russet, washed with
tender rose on the side of the sun and streaked with the same color
around the stem; flesh white, scented, a little coarse, semi-melting,
always gritty around the core; juice sufficient, sugary, acid, musky;
second; Sept.

Lorraine, it is called Carasi and in the district of Auge, France,
_Carisy_. Bunyard and Thomas in their joint work, "The Fruit Garden,"
mention _Carisie-Gros_ and _Carisie-Petit_ as varieties for perry
making, and they are probably two variations of the same pear, as too
are the _Carisi rouge_ and _Carisi blanc_ of France. The Carasi, or
_Rote Carisi_, of Austria is a beautiful fruit, large to very large,

This old French baking pear with over sixty synonyms is supposed to
have been found near Cadillac in the Gironde. Bonnefond in 1665 in the
_Jardinier François_ first described it under this name. The great size
of the Catillac has often caused it to be confused with the _Pound_
pear, and the latter's name has been applied as a synonym for the
Catillac, but the two are distinct. Tree stout, vigorous, spreading,
productive; leaf large, round, downy, serrate. Fruit very large,
broadly turbinate, dull green to yellow, with brownish-red blush; stem

In the sixteenth century this variety was also called the pear of
_Champagne_, coming as it did, according to Charles Estienne, from that
district in 1540. Its name may be referred to the Latin word _certo_
signifying constant or certain. Fruit above medium, long, variable,

1768. =4.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:266, fig. 1867.

Merlet writing in his _L'Abrégé des bon fruits_ of 1675 said that the
Chaumontel pear originated from a wilding growing at Chaumontel, Fr.
In 1765 Duhamel du Monceau saw the parent tree, at that time more than
a century old, bearing a fine crop. Fruit large; form variable, but
always long, obtuse, bossed, pyriform, yellow or yellowish-green in
the shade, dotted with numerous brownish-red spots and brownish-red or
deep rich red on the side exposed to the sun; flesh white, semi-fine,

=Chaumontel Gras. 1.= _Rev. Hort._ 468, fig. 1888.

In 1845 seed of the Chaumontel was sown from which was obtained in 1859
fruit whose seed was in turn sown. A seedling grown from this latter
seed bore fruit, which was reported about 1875 as follows: Fruit large
or very large, obtuse-pyriform, swelled, bossed, bright yellow, very

yellow when ripe, with a few streaks of red on the side next the sun;
juice musky; good; July.

=Choak-pear. 1.= Miller _Gard. Dict._ =3=: 1807.

The fruit of this pear is so acrid that it produces a choking
sensation. Its flesh is red and it is rarely cultivated.

=Choisnard. 1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:559, fig. 1867. =2.= _Guide
Prat._ 80. 1895.

=Church. 1.= _Mag. Hort._ =23=:112, fig. 5. 1857. =2.= Downing _Fr.
Trees Am._ 19. 1869.

_Vanilla._ =3.= Watson _Am. Home Gard._ 376, fig. 235. 1860.

Reported by Downing to have originated on land belonging to Trinity
Church at New Rochelle, N. Y., hence its name; but Dr. Brincklé, in the
second reference, says that it was believed to be a seedling raised
by an old Huguenot settler, and that the original tree still existed
on the premises of L. P. Miller, and was presumed to be nearly 100
years old. In 1859 Dr. Brincklé and Prince and Ferris expressed the
opinion that it was identical with _Platt's Bergamot_ and Mr. Colt
thought the _Clark_ pear of Hartford was also the same. Fruit medium,
globular-oblate, irregular, green becoming yellow at maturity, with
minute dots; flesh fine, very buttery, melting, with a very rich, sweet
and highly perfumed flavor; first; Sept.

=Chypre. 1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:561, fig. 1867. =2.= Hogg _Fruit
Man._ 571. 1884.

Duhamel in 1768, Poiteau in 1848 and Dr. Hogg in 1884 make this pear
synonymous with _Early Rousselet_. Leroy regards it as a separate
variety. It is an ancient pear of uncertain origin. It was described
by Merlet in 1675 and was cultivated even earlier by Le Lectier
in his garden at Orléans. Probably it originated at the beginning
of the seventeenth century, but whether it took its name from the
Island of Cyprus or the cypress tree seems uncertain. Fruit small,
globular-turbinate, bright grayish-green, stained with brownish-red on
the side of the sun; flesh dense, rather coarse, semi-breaking; juice
abundant, vinous, sugary, with a perfume recalling cinnamon; first as
an early pear; July and Aug.

This oriental pear, possibly of French origin, was received from
New York by S. F. Smith, Marietta, O., in 1854. It is the parent of
numerous seedlings fruited by Mr. Smith. Fruit medium to small, oval,
fairly regular, light greenish-russet, with numerous brown dots; skin
slightly rough; flesh yellowish-white, juicy, breaking, crisp; devoid
of flavor, poor; Oct.

=Cincincis Seedling. 1.= _Cornell Sta. Bul._ =332=:479. 1913.

identical with, Cincincis. Fruit medium to large, oblong, largest at
stem end, tapering to blossom end, smooth, creamy-yellow; flesh tender,
crisp, juicy, lacking quality.

=Cincinnatus. 1.= _Cornell Sta. Bul._ =332=:479. 1913.

An oriental seedling produced by S. F. Smith from seed of Cincincis.
Folette Smith, son of the originator, says, "The tree is vigorous,
hardy, productive; fruit resembles Cincincis in color and shape but is
quite distinct in quality; juicy, subacid, rich; flesh gritty."

Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:231, fig. 1867.

An ancient pear of obscure origin. In the middle of the seventeenth
century it was introduced for cultivation in France by La Quintinye,
gardener to King Louis XIV. It appears to have derived its name from
the Latin word _crassus_ which signifies thick. Some authorities
have suggested it was named after the celebrated Roman Consul Marcus
Lucinius Crassus who, with Julius Caesar and Pompey, formed the first
triumvirate, and who died 53 B.C. The balance of authority is in
favor of its having had a French origin. By Belgian and some French
and German writers it is known as the _Bergamotte Crassane_. Fruit
medium and above, globular, bossed, flattened at extremities, bright
greenish-yellow, veined and dotted with fawn; flesh buttery, melting,
tender, of a rich sugary flavor and perfume; a dessert pear of formerly

The origin of this ancient early summer variety is unknown, but it was
described by Mawe and Abercrombie in 1778, and was also mentioned by
Philip Miller in 1734 as being still "in prime" in July in England.
Under the name of _Guenette_ it was described by Merlet in articles
written in 1675, and 1690 and appears to have been well known in
English and French gardens. Hogg deems Chisel to be a corruption of the
French name Choiseul. Fruit small or very small, growing in clusters,

_Dict. Pom._ =2=:238, fig. 1869.

_Französische Gute Graue Sommerbirne._ =3.= Dochnahl _Führ. Obstkunde_
=2=:16. 1856.

The Dutch pomologist Pierre Van den Hoven writing in the middle of
the eighteenth century affirmed that the Grise-Bonne was the _Sucrée
Grise de Hollandaise_ and the _Pirum Falernum_ of the Romans. It may
be noted that in 1586 Jacques Daléchamp thought he had found the
_Falernum_ in the French _Autumn Bergamote_; and, again, in 1783 Henri
Manger declared it to be still cultivated under the name _Bourdon_,
the _Orange Musquée_; similarly Sickler wrote in 1802 that the
_Bergamote d'Été_ appeared to him to be the _Falernum_. Fruit medium;
form variable, sometimes irregular-turbinate, long and ventriculous,
at other times regular-turbinate, clear green, russeted with gray,
clouded with pale yellow on the shaded side and covered with large dots
of golden or orange-yellow; flesh white, fine, dense, semi-breaking,
watery, free from grit; juice very abundant, sugary, acidulous, musky;

_Kreiselförmige Blankette._ =3.= Mathieu _Nom. Pom._ 244. 1889.

This is one of a group of pears which in the seventeenth century were
designated by various pomologists with names such as _Blanquet à longue
queue_, _Blanquet d'hiver_, etc. Their origin is ancient, possibly
Roman. The variety here described is the largest of the Blanquettes and
was said by Olivier de Serres in 1600 to be also named _de Florence_
from which it might be adduced that it came originally from Tuscany.
Fruit below medium and often small, obtuse-pyriform, smooth, of a
beautiful yellow color, dotted with bright green and sometimes carmined
on the cheek next the sun; flesh white, semi-fine, breaking, sweet,
full of sugary juice possessing a musky-anis flavor; a dessert pear,
second; July and Aug.

=Gros Blanquet Rond. 1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =2=:242, fig. 1869.

An ancient dessert pear mentioned by Claude Saint-Etienne in the

coarse, almost exempt from grit; juice abundant, sugary, sourish,
musky; third for dessert; Sept.

=Gros-Hativeau. 1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =2=:245, fig. 1869.

This pear has been supposed to belong to a class identified with the
_Pira Hordearia_ of Columella and of Pliny, and was mentioned by
various French and German writers from the sixteenth century onward; if
its origin is not clear it is at any rate one of the three varieties
of the pear bearing the name of _Hativeau_ in the seventeenth century,
_H. blanc_, or _Bergamotte d'Été_, and the _Petit-H._ being the other
two. Fruit below medium, turbinate-obtuse; skin fine, yellowish-green,
delicately dotted with olive-gray, washed with bright vermilion on

or much sugar; second, but good for kitchen use; Jan. and Feb.

=Gros Muscat Rond. 1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =2=:248, fig. 1869.

Although the origin of this variety is doubtful it is almost certainly
French. Diel received it from Holland but German pomologists appear to
have regarded it as French. Claude Saint-Etienne described it in 1670.
Fruit medium, globular-ovate, mammillate at summit, one side always
more convex than the other, grayish-green on the shaded side and pale
yellow on that exposed to the sun, dotted and slightly stained with
gray-russet; flesh whitish, semi-fine and semi-breaking, watery, rarely
very gritty; juice plentiful, very saccharine, acidulous and aromatic;

_Roi d'Été._ =3.= Downing _Fr. Trees Am._ 843. 1869.

Mentioned by Rea as being cultivated in England in 1665 under the name
of _Great Russet of Remes_, under which name it was also known in
France, there being known these two varieties, the _Gros Rousselet de
Rheims_ and the _Petit-Rousselet_. Father Rapin, a French Jesuit, who
wrote in 1666 the poem _Hortorum_, mentioned the pears of Rousselet in
the Valley of Amiterne at the foot of the Apennines. In 1783 the German
pomologist Henri Manger wrote that he believed the French _Rousselet_
was none other than the Roman _Favonianum_ mentioned by Pliny. Fruit
medium, obtuse-pyriform, yellowish or bright green changing to bright
lemon-yellow, covered with numerous small brown spots, red on the
side next the sun; flesh yellowish, semi-melting, semi-breaking, rich

Hogg tells us that this and the Martin Sire are among the earliest
varieties known to have been grown in England, for they are mentioned
among the fruits delivered into the Treasury by the fruiterer of
Edward I in 1292. In 1530 Charles Estienne of Paris wrote of it as
being cultivated in France and affirmed the Pears of Saint Martin were
so named because their time of ripening coincided with the Festival
of that Saint. Again, in 1675 Merlet in his _Abrégé des bons fruits_
spoke of the Martin-Sec of Provins or of Champagne. Fruit medium or
above, long-pyriform-obtuse, regular in form, yellowish and russeted,

Man._ 615. 1884.

This pear, sometimes known as _Lord Martin Pear_, was grown in

said the name Martin-Sire which was the most generally recognized of
its many names originated from a former Lord of Ronville whose name was
Martin. Fruit medium, pyriform, obtuse and very regular; skin fine,

The original tree was planted at the beginning of the last century
close to the old Penn Manor in Pennsylvania and on the margin of land
which became the track of the Camden and Amboy Railroad. Inasmuch as
its position was so close to the railway the company threatened to cut
it down. Hence it acquired the name of _Railroad Fuss_ by which it was
known for many years. Fruit medium, oblate, sometimes globular-oblate,

Jean Mayer, director of the gardens of the Grand Duke of Wurtzburg,
Bavaria, in his _Pomona franconica_ published in 1801 showed that the
Petit-Muscat was the antique pear _Superba_ described by Pliny. Various
other pomologists wrote of it prior to Mayer as for instance Jacq.

Downing Fr. Trees Am. 846. 1869.

_Early Rousselet_. =3.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 571. 1884.

=Rousselet Précoce.= =1.= _Mag. Hort._ =18=:151. 1852. 2. Mas _Pom.
Gen._ =6=:91, fig. 430. 1880.

This is the variety known in Germany as _Frühe Geishirtlebirne_
and must be distinguished from the _Rousselet hâtif_ or _Poire de
Chypre_ of Duhamel. It was classed in 1851 by Mr. Cabot, President of
the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, among the new or recently
introduced fruits. Fruit rather small, pyriform, regular in contour,

=Rousselet de Rheims. 1.= Duhamel _Trait. Arb. Fr._ =2=:147, Pl. XI.
1768. =2.= Bunyard _Handb. Hardy Fr._ 196. 1920.

This pear is of very ancient and uncertain origin. Many authors have
endeavored to trace it back to the days of the Romans. But Pliny and
the other Latin horticulturists did not give descriptions of their
fruits sufficiently technical to enable us to make identification of
their varieties with ours certain. It is, however, clear that the
Rousselet de Rheims has existed, particularly around the city of Reims,
Fr., for some centuries. Fruit small, turbinate, regular in form,
rarely very obtuse, bright green or yellow-green, sprinkled with large
and small gray-russet dots and extensively shaded with reddish-brown
on the side opposed to the sun; flesh white, fine or semi-fine, almost
melting, not very juicy, rich in sugar, acidulous, refreshing, highly
perfumed; one of the best early pears for dessert, very good for
candying; Sept.

=Rousselet de Rheims Panaché. 1.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =2=:597, fig.
1869. =2.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 639. 1884.

A variety similar in all respects to the preceding, of which it is a
bud sport, except that the leaves and fruit are striped with yellow and
green. Its propagation antedates 1830.

=Rousselet Royal. 1.= _Guide Prat._ 104. 1876.

On trial with Messrs. Simon-Louis, Metz, Lorraine, in 1876. Fruit
medium; first; Sept.

=Rousselet Saint Nicolas. 1.= Mas _Le Verger_ =3=:Pt. 2, 13, fig. 103.
1866-73.

Obtained by M. Bivort. Fruit small, turbinate-ventriculous, gray-green
tinted with yellow, sprinkled with large brown or green dots, numerous
and evenly distributed, changing at maturity to pale yellow, the
side exposed to the sun being washed with brown-red on which are
blackish-red dots; flesh yellowish, very fine, melting, rather gritty
at the center, full of sweet juice, saccharine, agreeably perfumed;
good; Oct.

=Rousselet Saint-Quentin. 1.= Mas _Pom. Gen._ =7=:53, fig. 507. 1881.

_De Quentin_. =2.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 635. 1884.

Gained by M. Van Dooren, a former director of the middle school at
Namur, Bel. Fruit small or medium on a pruned tree, globular-ovate or
globular-conic, symmetrical in its contour, somber green sprinkled with
large, widely spaced gray dots, changing to yellow, and well colored
with brownish-red on the side next the sun; flesh white, slightly
greenish, fine, buttery; juice sufficient, saccharine, having the
characteristic perfume of the Rousselets; first; Sept. and Oct.

=Rousselet Saint Vincent. 1.= _Mag. Hort._ =16= 296. 1850. =2.= Leroy
_Dict. Pom._ =2=:598, fig. 1869.

The origin of this pear is uncertain. It seems probable to Leroy
that it was raised by Van Mons. In this country it was placed on the
Rejected List by the second Congress of Fruit Growers at New York
in 1850. Fruit above medium, globular-ovate, irregular in outline
especially at the summit, bright yellow, dotted with russet; flesh
white, fine, juicy, saccharine, acidulous, of a delicate flavor though
not recalling in the least that of the Rousselets; first; Oct.

=Rousselet de Stuttgardt. 1.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 639. 1884.

_Des Chevriers de Stuttgardt_. =2.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._ =1=:558, fig.
1867.

_Stuttgarter Geisshirtel_. 3. Oberdieck _Obst-Sort._ 289. 1881.

It is said that this was a wilding found by a shepherd in the
neighborhood of Stuttgart, Ger., before 1779. Fruit below medium,
pyriform, fine, tender, at first dark water-green sprinkled with very
numerous large dots of a darker shade, changing to yellow-green,
tinged on the side next the sun with brownish-red on which the dots
become yellow; the surface is covered with a characteristic sort of
grayish-white bloom which passes to a rosy-violet on the bright parts;
flesh greenish, not very fine but tender, buttery, sufficiently juicy,
aromatic; first; Aug.

=Rousselet Thaon. 1.= Mas _Pom. Gen._ =4=:73, fig. 229. 1879.

The Bulletin of the Van Mons Society appears to indicate that
Rousselet Thaon was a gain of M. Bivort. Fruit small, short-turbinate,
symmetrical in outline; skin thick, firm, bright green dotted with
darker green changing to pale yellow, the side next the sun being more
golden and washed with brown-red on fruits well exposed; flesh white,
coarse, semi-buttery; juice moderate in amount but saccharine and
perfumed with musk; second; Sept. and Oct.

=Rousselet Theuss. 1.= Mas _Le Verger_ =2=:37, fig. 17. 1866-73.

In his abridged descriptive Catalog published at Louvain in 1823 Van
Mons stated that the Rousselet Theuss was raised by him. Fruit small
or nearly medium, ovate-turbinate; skin rather thick and firm, at
first bright water-green, sprinkled with gray-green dots turning pale
yellow and encrimsoned on the side next the sun, sometimes very vividly
on well-exposed fruits; flesh white, slightly yellow under the skin,
semi-fine, melting, full of saccharine juice, acidulous, well perfumed
with the characteristic Rousselet scent; owing to its excellence and
beauty this pear deserves a place in the fruit garden as well as in the
large orchard; Aug.

=Rousselet Vanderwecken. 1.= _Ann. Pom. Belge_ =3=:41, fig. 1855.

Raised by M. Grégoire, Jodoigne, Bel. Tree pyramidal, of good vigor,
very productive. Fruit small, turbinate to ovoid, yellow; stem short,

aromatic; first; Nov.

=Rousseline. 1.= Duhamel _Trait. Arb. Fr._ =2=:153, Pl. XV. 1768. =2.=
Downing _Fr. Trees Am._ 847. 1869.

Merlet, the French pomologist, writing in 1675 appears to have been the
first to describe this pear and he said it was well named Rousseline
being so similar to Rousselet in the buttery character of its flesh
and its extraordinarily musky flavor. Fruit below medium, pyriform
inclining to obovate, swollen in the middle and narrowing obtusely
toward the calyx and more acutely toward the stalk, dull green
dotted with brown scales and partly covered with large russet stains
intermingled with gray mottlings; flesh white, fine, semi-melting,
some grit around the center; juice rarely abundant, highly saccharine,
vinous and musky; second; Nov. and Dec.

for the first time in 1846. Fruit medium and above, ovate, much
swelled in its lower part and contracted near its summit; skin very
shining, yellow-ochre, dotted with gray-russet, stained with the same
at either extremity and carmined on the cheek touched by the sun; flesh
yellow-white, semi-fine, semi-breaking, granular around the core; juice
rather deficient, saccharine, sweet, more or less perfumed, rather
delicate; second; Feb. to Apr.

=Roux Carcas. 1.= _Gard. Chron._ 55. 1865. =2.= Leroy _Dict. Pom._
=2=:602, fig. 1869.

This pear bears the name of a nurseryman at Carcassone, Aude, Fr., who
raised it in 1863. Fruit below medium or small, globular, flattened at

gray points, slightly marbled with russet; flesh whitish, coarse,
semi-melting, gritty at center; juice abundant, musky, and saccharine,
possessing a rather astringent after-taste; second; end of Aug.

=2.= Hogg _Fruit Man._ 640. 1884.

The origin of the Royal d'Hiver is uncertain. In 1704 Le Gentil,
director of the orchard at the Chartreux Convent of Paris, said that it
was a new pear and had been brought from Constantinople for the King
(Louis XIV). The Turkish origin of the pear, however, was probably
based on not much more than hearsay. Fruit large, turbinate-obtuse,
bossed; skin fine, dull lemon-yellow, washed with orange-red on the
side next the sun, dotted and marbled with fawn; flesh yellow-white,
fine, melting or semi-melting, juicy, saccharine, sweet and having a

=Russelet Petit. 1.= Langley _Pomona_ 132, Pl. LXIV. 1729.

Fruit small, pyramidal, irregular; stem set on one side obliquely; late
Aug.

=Russet Bartlett.=

About 1893 Robert McHinds, Clarksville, N. Y., planted 700 Bartlett
pear trees. When these trees came into bearing, one was found to
produce russet-colored fruits, whence the name Russet Bartlett. The
tree is an exact counterpart of Bartlett in manner of growth and the
fruit differs from Bartlett only in the russet skin. It is, therefore,
not improbable that the variety is a bud sport of Bartlett.

=Russet Catherine. 1.= Parkinson _Par. Ter._ 592. 1629.

"The Russet Catherine is a very good middle sized peare."

Brookshaw _Hort. Reposit._ =1=:Pl. XLIX, fig. 1. 1823. =3.= Hogg _Fruit
Man._ 661. 1884.

This variety originated at the village of Virgouleé, near Limoges, of
which the Marquis Chambrette was the baron, and by whom it was first
introduced about 1650. From this circumstance it has often been called
_Chambrette_, after the marquis. The tree is strong and vigorous but
is a late and indifferent bearer and is apt to drop its fruit before
ripe. It is said that the fruit is very susceptible to absorbing
odors and flavors and must be stored near materials which will
improve rather than impair the flavor. In Europe it is regarded as an
excellent dessert pear, but in this country it has not met with great
success. Fruit medium to large, pyriform, rounded towards the eye and
tapering thickly towards the stalk; skin smooth, delicate, lively green
becoming a beautiful pale lemon-yellow, sprinkled with numerous gray
and red dots; calyx small, open, set in a small shallow basin; stem
an inch long, fleshy at the base, attached with no depression; flesh
yellowish-white, delicate, buttery, melting, very juicy, with a sugary
and perfumed flavor; Nov. to Jan.

According to Leroy this variety originated in Holland, and was
published in 1771 under the name _Hallemine Bonne_ by Knoop. In French
gardens it received the name _Madame_. In England, Windsor is often
called _Cuisse Madame_. A "Windsor," which appears to be identical with
the Windsor of Knoop, is described by English writers as early as 1629.
Hogg quotes an English writer as saying, "It was raised from seed of
the _Cuisse Madame_, by a person of the name of Williamson ..." before
1750. Moreover, it is mentioned in 1592 as being cultivated about
Naples, and 1563 in England. What the origin is appears undeterminable.

abundant bearer; shoots remarkably stout, perfectly upright, dark
brown. Fruit large, pyriform or bell-shaped, very smooth, greenish
becoming pale yellow; stem long, fairly stout, inserted without

[25] Marshall P. Wilder contributed to all fields of American
horticulture as an ardent amateur grower and as a most generous patron.
But it was as a pomologist and especially as a grower of grapes
and pears that he established a permanent place for himself in the
horticulture of the country. He was born in New Hampshire in 1798 and
died in Boston in 1886, having lived in Dorchester, a suburb of Boston,
for upwards of a half century. By vocation a merchant, he was a captain
of industry in his day, yet most of his life, especially after the
prime had been passed, was devoted to the avocation of horticulture. He
was one of the founders of the American Pomological Society and had the
great honor of being its president, excepting a single two-year term,
from the first meeting in 1850 until his death. During the last years
of his presidency, Wilder actively engaged in the reform of pomological
nomenclature which the Society was then carrying on. He was an active
member of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society for fifty-six years
and its president from 1841 to 1848. He was also one of the founders
of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture, of the Massachusetts
Agricultural Society, of the United States Agricultural Society, and
was a trustee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Besides
membership and activity in these agricultural organizations, he served
as colonel and commander in a military company and as president of
the New England Historic and Genealogical Society from 1868 until his
death. Wilder was a zealous collector and introducer of flowers. He
specialized in camellias, azaleas, orchids, and roses. A rose bearing
his name is still a garden favorite. Many floral novelties of his
day owe their origin or introduction to Marshall P. Wilder. He was
ever enthusiastic over American grapes and tested all of the many new
varieties introduced about the middle of the last century. But the pear
was even more to his fancy than the grape, and he endeavored to grow
every native variety of any promise whatsoever. All told, he tested
over 1200 varieties, and in 1873 exhibited more than 400 varieties.
He originated several new pears and to him is due the honor of having
introduced the Beurre d'Anjou in 1844. At his death he left the
American Pomological Society $1000 for Wilder medals for new fruits and
$4000 for general purposes. To the Massachusetts Horticultural Society,
he left $1000 to encourage the introduction of new American pears and
grapes. Among many distinguished American pomologists who sought to
improve the pear, Marshall P. Wilder deserves most of any recognition
for his services and a place is therefore accorded him for his likeness
in the frontispiece of _The Pears of New York_ and the book is thereby
dedicated to him.

[26] The name is spelled by many writers Beurré d'Aremberg.

[27] General Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn, who followed the
vocation of a soldier, statesman, and author, chose as his avocation
horticulture and in several of its fields became eminent. A native of
New England (1783-1851), son of General Henry Dearborn of Revolutionary
fame, he was early educated to the profession of law and pursued
that vocation until the war with Great Britain in 1812. Services in
this war brought him the rank and title of general. After the war he
served as Collector of the Port of Boston, in Congress, and as Mayor
of Roxbury, Massachusetts, which office he held at the time of his
death. But it is as a patron, friend, and lover of horticulture that
the life and work of General Dearborn interest pomologists. He was one
of the charter members in the Massachusetts Horticultural Society and
a prime mover in its organization. He was elected its first president
March 17, 1829. In the history of the Society published in 1880, of
all the famous members of this truly remarkable organization, General
Dearborn's portrait was chosen for the frontispiece. He was early
interested in experimental gardens and rural cemeteries. The plans for
experimental gardens advocated by him were never fully carried out,
but no doubt his enthusiasm for such gardens, with his own garden as a
model, did much to stimulate the planting in America in the early half
of the nineteenth century of the many famous gardens which adorned and
enriched every center of culture along the Atlantic seaboard. He helped
to establish the Mount Auburn and Forest Hills cemeteries, famous
among Boston cemeteries, and the first of rural cemeteries in this
country. His life-long devotion to rural art as exemplified in gardens
and cemeteries knew no bounds. On these subjects and on pomology he
contributed many articles to the agricultural and horticultural papers
of his time. Few men, it can be said, could better concentrate their
thoughts and feelings on paper than he seems to have done. Besides the
many papers from his own pen he published several translated treatises
from the French, chief of which was a monograph on the Camellia in 1838
and another on _Morus multicaulis_ in 1830, the "Mulberry Craze" being
in full swing at this time. General Dearborn was an ardent pear-grower
and helped to test the hundreds of seedlings then being brought from
Belgium and France and grew as well considerable numbers from his own
seed-beds. Of all his seedlings, however, only Dearborn survives.

[28] The fame of Robert Manning as an accurate and discriminating
American pomologist will long endure. Few Americans, one conceives, as
his life is reviewed, have rendered greater service in any field of
the nation's agriculture. The quantity of his work was not remarkably
large, but the quality was superfine. Systematic pomology in particular
owes him much for his painstaking descriptions of fruits, and his
corrections in nomenclature. Born in Salem, Mass., July 18, 1784, he
made the town of his birth famous as a pomological center in America,
where, at the time of his death, October 10, 1842, his garden probably
contained a larger collection of fruits than had ever before been
brought together in America. Manning began collecting fruits in 1823
when he established his "Pomological Garden" at Salem for the purpose
of introducing and testing new varieties of fruits. He attempted to
bring together all of the varieties of fruits that would thrive in
eastern Massachusetts, and when his garden was fullest had about 2000
fruits, of which 1000 kinds were pears, to which fruit he gave most
attention. He had many English, French, and Belgian correspondents from
whom he received the most notable fruits grown in their countries.
He is said to have had a most remarkable memory and could carry in
mind the names, tree-habits, and qualities of any fruit he had ever
seen and could identify it at sight. In whatever group of pomologists
he chanced to be, his identifications and decisions on nomenclature
were accepted as correct. Small wonder, therefore, that the _Book
of Fruits_, published by Manning in 1838, at once took the place of
authority for descriptions of tree-fruits and for such small-fruits,
trees, and shrubs as the author described. It was the first, and is
almost the only, American pomology in which the descriptions were all
made with fruit in hand. The author intended this book to be the first
of a series, but the books to follow never appeared. He was one of
the founders of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. Pear-growers
are indebted to Manning for the work he did in testing the seedlings
sent out by Van Mons, the famous Belgian breeder, most of whose pears
came to American orchards through the agency of the Salem Pomological
Garden. He also received and introduced valuable pears from the London
Horticultural Society. His achievements mark Manning among the most
notable American pomologists, of whom no other labored as devotedly for
the attainment of better pears.

[29] Bernard S. Fox was a pioneer nurseryman and fruit-grower in
California who gave much time to improving the pear through seedlings.
During his stay of thirty years in the state of his adoption he was
noted for his energy and enterprise in every industry that had to
do with fruit-growing. Fox was an Irishman who came to America in
1848 and began work in the garden and nurseries of Hovey and Company
of Boston. A few years later he emigrated with the gold-seekers to
California where, shortly, he settled at San Jose as a nurseryman and
fruit-grower. Eventually he became possessed of a considerable amount
of land the increasing value of which made him a very wealthy man, and
he took pleasure in being a patron of horticulture as well as a worker
in its several fields. Early in his career at San Jose his interest
was aroused in the production of new pears from seed. He was a most
conscientious selecter and only the best survived in his orchards. He
was at all times extremely anxious not to cumber the list of pears with
worthless varieties. Out of a great number of seedlings, only three
finally received his approval, P. Barry, Fox, and Colonel Wilder. All
have high places in the pear lists of California and the United States,
and do honor to an enthusiastic and painstaking breeder of pears. For
many years before his death in July, 1880, he was the Vice President
of the American Pomological Society for California. Bernard S. Fox
was one of the first fruit-growers to bring fame to California, and
Californians are justly proud of him.

[30] Peter Kieffer, a nurseryman of good reputation in his state,
deserves pomological honors because of his keenness of vision in
selecting for distribution the pear which bears his name. Few men would
have recognized merit in the seedling from which the Kieffer pear
came. Peter Kieffer was born in Alsace in 1812, whence he emigrated to
America in 1834. In Europe he had worked for twelve years in the garden
of the King of France and upon his arrival in America sought employment
as a gardener which he found on the estate of James Gowen at Mt. Airy,
near Philadelphia. In 1853 he started a small nursery at Roxborough,
a short distance from Philadelphia. Much of his stock was imported
from Europe, most of which came from Van Houtte, the famous Belgian
nurseryman. From Van Houtte, Kieffer obtained seeds of the Chinese
Sand pear from which came the Kieffer pear as described in the history
of the variety. As a token of his faith in his new variety, Kieffer
planted an orchard of this pear, some of the trees of which still
live and bear. Peter Kieffer died in 1890, having made an important
contribution to horticulture even though the variety sent out by him is
far from perfect and has been much over-praised and over-planted.

[31] Patrick Barry, one of the founders of the firm of Ellwanger and
Barry, whose Mount Hope Nurseries at Rochester, New York, were long of
national and international reputation, was born in Belfast, Ireland,
in 1816 and died in Rochester, N. Y., in 1890. Besides contributing
to the fame of the nursery company he helped to found, Barry was for
many years one of the leading pomological editors and authors of the
country. New York, especially western New York, is greatly indebted
to George Ellwanger and Patrick Barry for the horticultural services
of their firm. It is not an exaggeration to say that they introduced
fruit-growing in western New York, a region now famous for its fruits.
So, also, the parks and home grounds of the many beautiful cities,
towns, and villages in western New York are adorned and enriched by
ornamental trees, shrubs and vines from the nurseries of Ellwanger and
Barry. Patrick Barry came to America in 1836 and with George Ellwanger
founded the Mount Hope Nurseries in 1840. Here for a half century he
devoted himself to the introduction and distribution of fruit and
out-of-door ornamental plants. In the early life of the nursery company
many importations were made from Europe and at a time when there were
no railroads, telegraph wires, nor ocean steamboats. It was during this
early period that the Mount Hope Nurseries began the importation of
pears and soon built up one of the largest collections in the country
and one which was maintained long after the famous collections farther
east had disappeared. At one time or another over 1000 varieties of
pears were tested on the grounds of this nursery. For a half century,
fruit-growers have studied with pleasure and profit the exhibits of
pears made by Ellwanger and Barry at the State and National exhibitions
of note. From 1844 to 1852, Patrick Barry edited _The Genesee Farmer_,
one of the best agricultural papers of its day and succeeded A. J.
Downing in the editorship of _The Horticulturist_ which he brought to
Rochester in 1855 where it was published until 1887. Barry's _Treatise
on the Fruit-Garden_ appeared in 1851 and at once became one of the
most popular books on pomology. In 1872 the "Treatise" was rewritten
and published as _Barry's Fruit Garden_. Another notable work of which
he was author was _The Catalogue of Fruits of the American Pomological
Society_ which was compiled by him. Patrick Barry was one of the
founders of the Western New York Horticultural Society, for many years
the leading horticultural organization of the continent, and of which
he was president for more than thirty years. Patrick Barry ranks with
Coxe, Kenrick, the Downings, Warder, Eliot, and Thomas as a great
leader in pomology of the time in which he lived.

William Crawford Barry, son of Patrick Barry of the preceding sketch,
was born in Rochester, New York, in 1847. As a boy he attended
parochial schools at Rochester and at Seton Hall, South Orange, New
Jersey. As a young man he studied in Berlin, Heidelberg, and the
University of Louvain in Belgium. Upon returning to America he took
a position in a seed house in New York that he might have practical
knowledge of the seed business to bring to the firm of Ellwanger
and Barry of which he was soon to become a member. After serving an
apprenticeship in the seed business he returned to Rochester to enter
the firm which his father and George Ellwanger had founded. From the
time of entrance in this company he took a prominent part in its
affairs, and for many years before his death, December 12, 1916, he was
president of the corporation. Of his horticultural activities, he may
be said to have been an organizer and promotor--one of the captains in
the industry. For twenty-six years he was president of the Western New
York Horticultural Society, having succeeded his father to this office.
He was the first president of the American Rose Society, and in 1882
was president of the Eastern Nurserymen's Association. For three years
he was president of the Board of Control of the New York Agricultural
Experiment Station. He helped to establish and took a leader's part
in developing the parks of Rochester which have made that city famous
among lovers of landscapes. Highland Park was almost a creation of the
firm of Ellwanger and Barry. In 1888 the firm gave the city twenty
acres of land adjoining the Highland reservoir as the first step in
establishing a park system for Rochester. Mr. Barry was chairman of the
committee of the park board having in charge Highland Park from the
creation of the board until the year before his death when it passed
out of existence. Besides these horticultural activities, Mr. Barry
was either president or an officer in six banks and trust companies in
Rochester. His was a commanding figure in the horticulture of New York.
No one attending the meetings of the Western New York Horticultural
Society during the twenty-six years he was president can forget Mr.
Barry. His knowledge in every division of horticulture, his devotion
to grape and pear culture, his genial manner and pleasant greeting
to all members, and his force and tact as a presiding officer fitted
him so preëminently well for the place that he was unopposed for the
presidency during twenty-six terms following the death of his father
and until his death.

George Ellwanger, one of the founders and thereafter until his death
one of the partners in the Mount Hope Nurseries, Rochester, New
York, was born in Germany in 1816 and died in Rochester, New York,
in 1906. He came to the United States in 1835, having been educated
as a horticulturist in Stuttgart, although possibly the training he
received throughout his youth from his father, a grower of grapes and
fruits, taught him most, for Ellwanger often said that it was from
his father that he acquired his love of horticulture and was by him
persuaded to devote his life to the vocation of nurseryman. Ellwanger
settled in Rochester in 1839, and the next year joined with Patrick
Barry in forming the nursery and seed firm of Ellwanger and Barry,
calling their place of business "Mount Hope Nurseries." Ellwanger was
one of the founders of the American Pomological Society, and of the
Western New York Horticultural Society and throughout his life took an
active interest in both organizations. Mr. Ellwanger had large business
interests in Rochester and western New York and helped most materially
to develop the city and the country about. His chief contributions to
horticulture were made through the Mount Hope Nurseries, the influence
of which is briefly set forth in the sketch of the life of Patrick
Barry.

[32] Henry Waggoman Edwards, at one time Governor of Connecticut,
was a pioneer American pear breeder credited with making the first
systematic attempt to grow new pears in this country. He was a grandson
of the eminent theologian, Jonathan Edwards, was born at New Haven,
Conn., in 1779, graduated at Princeton College in 1797, studied law
at the Litchfield School and almost immediately entered into public
life shortly to become prominent and famous in state and nation. He
served Connecticut with honors as its Governor, and in the nation he
distinguished himself as Representative in the House from Connecticut,
Speaker of the House and as Senator. But it is as a pomologist that his
career is of concern to the reader. Always interested in pomology, and
no doubt especially interested in pears through the spectacular work
of Van Mons, he planted pear seeds in the fall of 1817 with the aim of
obtaining new and superior varieties of this fruit. Great success did
not attend his attempts at pear breeding, but Governor Edwards made a
start in work which Manning, Wilder and a score of others were to carry
forward with more striking results. Out of many seedlings, at least
five were named and were grown for a longer or shorter time by the
pear-growers of a century ago. These are Elizabeth, Calhoun, Dallas,
Henrietta and Citron, all described among the minor varieties of this
text. While hardly to be considered among the foremost pomologists of
the country, Governor Edwards is in the front rank of the lesser men
whose combined work has done so much to give weight and impulse to
American pomology.
